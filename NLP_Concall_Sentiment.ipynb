As a reminder, all participants\\u2019 lines will be in the listen -only mode and there \\nwill be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need \\nassistance during the conference call, please signal  an operator by pressing \\u2018*\\u2019 then \\u20180\\u2019 on your \\ntouchtone telephone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand \\nthe conference over to Mr. Diwakar Pingle from Christensen IR. Thank you and over to you, sir.  \\nDiwakar Pingle : Welcome everyone and thanks for joining the Q1 FY17 Earnings call for Neuland Laboratories \\nLimited. Please note that the results have been made to you and you can also view this on our \\nwebsite at www.neulandlabs.com.  \\n To take us through the results for thi s quarter to answer your questions we have with us the \\nmanagement represented by Mr. Sucheth Rao, Vice Chairman & CEO; Mr. Saharsh Rao, Joint \\nManaging Director and Anil Kumar who is the CFO.  \\n We will be starting the call with a brief over view given by Sah arsh providing a brief of the \\ncompany\\u2019s performance which will then be followed by Q&A session.  \\n I would like to remind you that everything said on this call may reflects  any outlook for the \\nfuture or which can be constitute as a forward -looking statement. It must be viewed in \\nconjunction with  uncertainties and the risks that we face.  These uncertainties and risks are \\nincluded but not limited to what we have mentioned in our prospectus filed with SEBI and \\nsubsequent annual report which you can find on our website.  \\n With that said, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Saharsh Rao. Over to you, sir.  \\nSaharsh Rao:  Good morning everyone. A warm welcome to all of you who have logged on to this call. Let me \\nstart with the financial first and then move onto some business highlights . For the quarter of Q1 \\nFY17 the total operating income was Rs. 149.77 crores compared to Rs. 123.72 crores for the \\nsame quarter last year representing an increase of 21%. The EBITDA stood at Rs. 25.05 crores \\ncompared to Rs. 21.63 crores for the same quarter of FY16, an increase of 16%.  \\n The EBITDA margin is at 16.7% for Q1 FY17 as against 17.5 % for Q1 FY16. Net profit stood \\nat Rs. 9.71 crores for the quarter as compared to Rs. 7.3 crores for Q1 of last financial year. \\nBasic EPS stood at Rs. 10.93 crores as against Rs. 8.22 crores in Q1 of FY16. If I have to quickly \\ndissect the results the key h ighlights would be our revenues have been the highest in the quarter \\nin the history of the company and that is positive. The EBITDA margins are stable but you must \\nunderstand that the same is the function of the product mix and hence the same has been cons tant \\ncompared to last quarter. When we compare the EBITDA of this quarter with the Q1 of last \\nfiscal there is a difference due to onetime payments that Neuland received from APIC which \\nwere a part of other income in Q1 FY16.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 3 of 13 \\n Other highlights from a busine ss mix perspective about 47% of revenues came from prime \\nproducts, 29% from niche API and the remaining 23% came from CMS business. You would \\nrecall that starting from last quarter onwards management has decided to give the business \\nsaliency information as  well and this breakdown that I just shared is a part of that initiative.  \\n The CMS business also has another highlight continues to see improved traction and from a \\nproject perspective the company is currently working on about 10 projects; 9 in Q4 of FY16 and \\n1 in Q1 of FY16 of which 6 are in commercial stage and 4 are in clinical stage. From an \\noperational perspective some of the key highlights include successfully cleared ANVISA audit \\nfor the unit 2. This is the regulatory agency from Brazil. Also continu ed business momentum in \\nSalmeterol one of the products that we have been talking about as it gets commercialized. We \\nhave added new customers as well as penetrated new markets for this product. Then progress in \\nnew GDS API called Deferasirox with addition of new customers and initiation of supplies for \\nvalidation batches in multiple geographies and also another highlight would be encouraging \\ninitial response from the Chinese pharmaceutical markets where we have initiated sale of several \\nnew APIs.  \\n So to sum marize I think this was a very strong quarter in terms of financial performance as well \\nas the operating parameters. We believe that this momentum will build as we move forward and \\nare cautiously confident of the growth prospects of the company for the fin ancial year.  \\n Having said this, I would like to now throw open the floor to Q&A. Sucheth, Anil and I will try \\nto respond as much as we can. Over to you, Diwakar.  \\nModerator : Thank you  very much, sir . Ladies and gentlem en, we will now begin the question -and-answer \\nsession.  \\nWe have t he first question from the line of Abdul Puranwala from Centrum Broking . Please go \\nahead.  \\nAbdul Puranwala : My first question is regarding the revenue growth . So in Q4 you have stated that there was one \\ndeferred order which has been passed on to Q1 that is the current quarter. So can you tell me \\nwhat would be the actual growth barring that one particular order?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  Abdul , I think there was a reference mad e in the previous quarter that there have been some \\norders which were not fulfilled at the end of Q4 and those would be spilled over to Q1. I think \\nyou are referring to that comment, is that right?  \\nAbdul Puranwala : Yes, sir. \\nSaharsh Rao:  So I think it is fair to comment , Abdul , that in our business there are always going to be orders, \\ndeliveries certain products which are going to fall towards the end of the month or end of a  Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 4 of 13 \\nquarter and invariably it is beyond operations control as to when it will get bil led. So to answer \\nthe question specifically would be very difficult because to be honest we would continue to have \\nthose kind of spillovers of opportunit ies in our normal business . So for example there would be \\norders in Q1 also which we may have originall y plan to have delivered in Q1 but may have \\nspilled over to Q2. So in summary it is not really prudent to look at the impact of that because \\nthe growth that we have achieved we believe is a realistic fundamental growth.  \\nAbdul Puranwala : And my second quest ion would be regarding the Salmeterol, so which new geography have we \\nintroduced Salmeterol?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So these customers are customers within the European region , Abdul, these are probably second \\ntier customers who are going for late launches and they are different countries within Europe as \\nwell as other regions.  \\nAbdul Puranwala : And so for FY 18 we had given previously  a revenue guidance of Rs. 750 crores so do we still \\nmaintain that?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  We have actually never given revenue guidance , Abdul , so not sure where your comment is \\ncoming from.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Hareesha Kakkera from BOB Capital Markets. \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nHareesha Kakkera:  I just wanted to know what is the growth rate in Salmeterol that you have achieved and going \\nahead what could be the growth rate?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  Thanks for the question . We actually have not disclosed growth rate s especially within the \\nproduct individually . So that  is a question that we would not be able to answer.  \\nHareesha Kakker a: And I just wanted to know like which phases of the molecules are you concentrating right now, \\nit seems that it is more of Phase -2 and Phase -3 and are you continuing the same going ahead?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So typically our approach in this CMS business , Haree sha, is to look for opportunities which are \\nin Phase -2, Phase -3 because that is the right time for us to partner as a contract manufacturing \\norganization . But the way we actually visualize our business is that molecules will continue from \\nPhase -2 to Phase -3 and commercialization so over time the number of commercial opportunities \\nwill increase. So that  is the model t hat we are pursuing . Having said that we do pursue \\nopportunity directly in commercial as well . So sometimes we do talk to pharmaceutical \\ncompan ies who already have a commercial molecule and are looking for a second supplier or a \\nthird supplier where Neuland tries to go and enter that role. So there is no clinical part of \\ndevelopment over there where we become directly part of the commercial.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 5 of 13 \\nHare esha Kakkera:  And what are the new geographies you are tapping for the CMS business?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  CMS typically we focus on Europe, North America and Japan these have been predominantly \\nour three main regions . On top of that we do also actively look for opportunities with Indian \\npharmaceutical companies as well. But obviously we have different criteria within these markets \\nwhich I perhaps may not be able to elaborate because of the time limitations.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Amish Kanani from JM Financial. Please go ahead.  \\nAmish Kanani:  Can you give us some flavor of what type of products are we selling under the niche API given \\nthe confidentiality you may not be able to name all of them, but if you can just give us what type \\nof API we are designing as niche, one. And  two, what kind of margins are we getting from that \\nsay vis-\\u00e0-vis a blended margin that we have for their business ? And  third, if you can just also \\nelaborate on this surplus land agreement how much is the land and some flavor on that?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  With regards to niche generic A PIs these are typically molecules which are differentiated either \\nbecause of the method of use of the products . So they are typically they are injectable, APIs are \\ngoing to injectable formula tion, APIs are going to trans dermal  patches or into  inhalation \\nproducts etcetera or another way of defining a niche API would be molecule which is extremely \\ncomplex in nature where chemically it is very challenging to manufacture it. What it means from \\na market point of view for a niche generic A PIs is that the market itself may not be very large \\nbut the opportunity for a company like Neuland to penetrate that market and gain a significant \\nmarket share would be quite high.  \\nSo typically niche generic A PIs would not be very large in terms of turnover topline, but very \\nhigh in terms of margins as well as the market share opportunity for Neuland itself . And we have \\ngiven examples of molecules like Salmeterol , Propofol in the past . There is a molecule called \\nDeferasirox which we talked about in this release . We talked about Paliperidone in the past . \\nThese are all examples of niche generic A PIs. And with regards to margins we would not like to \\ncomment specifically about the margin profile of niche generics but as I mentioned in my earlier \\ncomment these are typically higher margin products compared to our prime products . So \\ntherefore we expect them to contribute positively to the margin of the business.  \\nAnd then finally with your question about Nanakramguda, the property that is being developed \\nwith Phoenix this is actually a joint development agreement . So Neuland actually does not \\ncontribute to any investments into this project this land actually is located in one of the \\ndeveloping parts of the city where a lot of corporate offices are coming up and the developer \\nwould actually build office space which would be shared in the ratio of 23% to 77% \\napproximately. And it  is from Neuland\\u2019s point of view, it is a very positive development because \\nwithout any further inv estments other than what we have done in the past, we will be able to \\nacquire 23% of share.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 6 of 13 \\nAmish Kanani:  So what was the land in terms of acres or square feet sir, if you can share that?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  It is a five-acre plot. \\nAmish Kanani:  And sir , can we a ssume that the niche generic, we have a EBITDA margin in the range of 17%, \\n17.5% . So can we assume that niche generic would be say more than 25% margin?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  It really depends on product -to-product so it would be hard to comment on that.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. We take the next question from the line of Tushar Mundhane from Anand Rathi. \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nTushar Mundhane:  With respect to prime segment, I just would like to understand the volume growth and the pricing \\ngrowth for the quarter?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So I think within the quarter the pri me products have contributed to about 47% of our top line \\nwhich you would imagine is close to about Rs. 70 crores,  Rs. 72 crores. S o this is actually largely \\ndriven by about five or six products which are part of the p rime category. Within these products \\nwe have not really given specific breakdown of products itself . But in terms of general trends it \\nis hard to comment on volume as well as pricing trends together as a group because there are \\nproducts where there is a de clining trend of pricing, there are products where there is price \\nstability and there are products where price is also increasing.  \\nManagement:  But generally overall we do expect that the revenue growth from prime products will not be \\naggressive, it will always be a modest growth because those are products where we have already \\nestablished our market share where the product itself is not growing s ignificantly.  \\nTushar Mundhane : API kind of legacy , API kind of business and say let us say a couple of companies because of \\nthe oil based products with the fall in crude oil prices and all there has been sharp reduction in \\nprices for them because of subseq uent fall in the raw material prices. So is that effect seen in our \\ncase also?  \\nManagement : No, so when we say prime products we are actually referring to Neuland\\u2019s products , right . Prime \\ndoes not mean that they are actually commodity API s. So prime products for us might actually \\nbe very good products for somebody else . So I think we are reasonably insulated from our \\nmargins being significantly impacted by crude oil prices . I think that macro fluctuation in these \\ncommodities impact the price of our so lvent s and some other smaller materials . But I do not see \\nthat they will have a huge impact on the margins of our prime APIs.  \\nTushar Mundhane:  And my second question is with respect to the sequential drop in gross margin, if you can help \\nme understand that ?  Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 7 of 13 \\nManagement : So I would encourage you not to read too much into a quarter to quarter change in the gross \\nmargin or a slight change in the EBITDA margin because that will it is a product with which \\nimpact that and you will see that fluctuation on a quarter -to-quarter basis.  \\nTushar Mundhane:  Because sequentially also we have seen the improvement in the sales contribution from CMS \\nand niche segment despite that we are having the falling gross margin that  is the reason why the \\nquestion?  \\nManagement : Tushar , again gross margins for the quarter is about 53% whereas for the full year of last year it \\nhas been slightly lower, it is about 51%. So for the quarter it is okay, it is fairly compared on a n \\nannualized basis of last year it is okay. It is in line with that o r slightly better.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ashish Rathi from Infina Finance. Please go ahead.  \\nAshish Rathi:  I just wanted to understand if you can we treat this like a base quarter and going ahead can we \\nassume that we will see growth from here onwards, on these numbers?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So I think as I mentioned earlier we think that the growth that we have achieved is a fundamental \\ngrowth . And I think the journey in our business is such that every quarter has a different \\ncharac teristic to it. S o we cannot help you with a clear definition . But I think hopefully that \\nshould give you enough clarity.  \\nAshish Rathi:  Okay and secondly on the margins that the top line is growing good and the margins we have \\nstill in  the band of like 15%  20% odd . We have been indicating around 20% . So should we like \\nwill we be looking as an inflection at some point in time or how should we look at the margins \\ntrajectory going forward ? I mean when do we see actually a continual improvement happening \\nor sho uld we wait for an in junction ? \\nSaharsh Rao:  I do not think there will be an inflection itself , Ashish , but it will be a gradual ramp up in margin \\nas you know the margin the business mix changes and continues to improve as well as \\noperational leverage kicks  in. So we are able to generate more turnover from the same facilit ies. \\nThe combination of these two factors will actually drive the margins . When we will get to a \\ncertain milestone is really dependent on how and when we execute the business mix . So it is \\nhard for us to comment on that but I can tell you that there will not be any inflections, it will be \\na gradual move and it will not be a linear move as well.  \\nAshish Rathi:  Just to add to that in terms of the debt position where are we right now and how sho uld we see \\nthis going ahead, the debt number?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  The debt position if you see it  is about almost like Rs. 175 crores . It is  in terms of net worth we \\nare about Rs. 195 crores . So it is lower than one. T he long term debt is about Rs.  45 crores and \\nthe short term debt is about for the working capital requirement is about Rs.  130 crores.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 8 of 13 \\nAshish Rathi:  So do we intend to  repay this debt or how do we look at it ? Will there be raising further debts or \\nCAPEX will we need that? H ow do we keep the debt syst em moving for the company\\u2019s \\nbasically ? \\nSaharsh Rao:  See if you look at the CAPEX position for the company we said in the last quarters saying that \\nthe CAPEX for the year is about close to about Rs. 22 crores and we would be largely fundi ng \\nit through internal accruals.  \\nManagement:  And in addition to that just an additional comment is see our goal is to keep debt always at a \\nhealthy level . Currently our debt equity is less than 1 so up to about 1.5 to 2 times is considered \\nreasonable and not too risky . So we will always like to keep our debt equity at a very healthy \\nlevel . Working capital will always be around 30% of our overall sales, 2 8% to 30%. So going \\nforward that is how we would like to maintain . Of course there will be changes based on \\nrequirement . It will be up and down but you will see that it will always be maintained at these \\nlevels.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. The n ext question is from the line of Saravanan Viswanathan from Unifi Capital . \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nSaravanan Viswanathan:  I would like to know if Evolven ce has exited from the parent company or they are still the \\nshareholders?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  I think this question has been asked in the previous calls as well . Now since that  is a transaction \\nthat is happening in the holding company we will not elabor ate on it but the process is going on . \\nSo it is not yet complete.  \\nSaravanan Viswanathan:  Okay and in terms of the real estate you had mentioned that it is pertaining to office space, during \\nthis quarter have we received any specific income from this arrang ement in terms of some initial \\nfee or something?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  No, nothing.  \\nSaravanan Viswanathan:  And my last question . So can we assume that we have moved from the Rs. 120 crore s base to \\nRs. 140 crore s base in terms of quarterly revenue s? \\nSaharsh Rao:  That is your assumption to make I have actually just mentioned to one of the previous \\nparticipants that I think this growth is a fundamental growth . But having said that we always \\nhave challenges as a business . But we are quite optimistic about the busines s going forward as \\nwell. But we do not want to give any specific guidance in terms of what  is the base.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ayush Surana from Ethos Capital. Please go ahead.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 9 of 13 \\nAyush Surana:  I just have one question to ask . Have we tied up with an Israeli firm for API contract, are we \\nsupplying to them?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  We cannot comment on any specific products so I am sorry I will not be able to answer that.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Amish Kanani from JM Financial. Please go ahead.  \\nAmish Kanani:  I had a question about given that niche proportion of the business this quarter is reasonably \\nhigher than the last quarter same time, still our EBITDA margins are in the same range . So what \\nwould you attrib ute it to ? So the question is given that prime is lowering and still our margins \\nare in this range, what do we take apart from say product mix which might be the explanation?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  I think in terms of the margins itself it is a factor of multiple it  is actually a combination of \\nmultiple factors . So while the niche generic APIs has increased there are many factors that totally \\nimpact the margin of the business. So it will be hard for us to give you any kind of firm factor \\nas to why the margin has not improved . I think I will go back to my previous comment to say \\nthat as the business mix continues to increase and the operational leverage continues to increase \\nwhich means that as we continue to generate more revenue from our facilities we anticipate that  \\nthe margin will continue to increase.  \\nAmish Kanani:  Sir, in that context what is our operational capitalization if you were to kind of put some number \\nthere?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So we believe that our facilities together we operate two manufacturing facilities t hey put \\ntogether with some maintenance and debottlenecking CAPEX we would be able to generate Rs. \\n750 crores to Rs. 850 crores of revenue given an optimal business mix . And this is something \\nthat could change plus or minus but that is something that we thi nk is possible from our existing \\nfacilities.  \\nAmish Kanani:  So you are saying in that level the margins will improve is what you are saying?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  Yes. \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Vishal Singhania, Retail investor. Please go ahead.  \\nVishal Singhania:  Sir, you had said in the last conference call that you expect to reach full capacity by FY17. So \\ndo you still stand by that?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  We have not mentioned that we would reach full capacity by FY17, we have actually said tha t \\nwe would have to continue to augment capacity. A nd as a part of that Anil had also mentioned \\nin an earlier comment that we will be doing some level of debottlenecking capacity creations  \\nwithin the two facilities.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 10 of 13 \\nVishal Singhania:  Okay sir and the next question is sir, Teva  Pharmaceuticals from the US said that they would be \\nlaunching the Huntington disease  drug in the second half of financial year 2017, in the second \\nhalf of 2017 that is . So do we expect some kind of growth coming in from there as we su pply \\nAPIs for Huntington  series?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So we have actually not mentioned specifically which customers we are working with for which \\nproducts so obviously this is a question that I cannot answer.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line o f Sri Srihari from PCS Securities. Please go ahead.  \\nSri Srihari:  Two questions basically . If you talk about the complex generics space I would like to know what \\nare the meaningful opportunities,  you are looking out for over the next 18 to 24 months ? And \\nsecondly on the custom manufacturing side you mentioned for six commercial molecules you \\nare trying to make an entry there . So what is the kind of market share you might have gained in \\nthose products?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So with regards to the niche generic APIs right now a lot of products comprise this category so \\nwe have talked about Salmeterol, Paliperidone in the past molecules which are a part of this \\ncategory . I think going forward we will continue to strive to launch more products in this \\ncategory and as a result we will hope to commercialize more of them going forward. One of the \\nproducts I mentioned in today\\u2019s call in my opening comments was Deferasirox which is a \\nmolecule again which is a part of this category, very interesting product for which we are lo oking \\nat global market share.  \\nThis is a molecule whose patent expires in 2019 . Again we will not have the time to elaborate a \\nlot of products but there are other  molecules  as well such as Pro pofol, Escitalopram , \\nSuga mmadex, Donepezil  etcetera which are all  part of this category and will continue to have \\ngood opportunities for Neuland going forward. There is also a product called Labetalol  which \\nwe mentioned in our earlier updates as a molecule . That is an old molecule but is being scaled \\nup. Labetalol  is also an example of a niche generic API wherein Neuland is actually trying to \\ncreate a very good market opportunity for a molecule that actually has been generic for quite \\nsome time.  \\nSri Srihari:  And what about Lurasidone ? \\nSaharsh Rao:  That is a molecule whic h is part of our product list, it is still under development . I believe it is \\nstill early to comment on the prospects of it . But we are doing the validation for that molecule \\nthis year.  \\nSri Srihari:  And regards to the six custom manufacturing product s that you mentioned?   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 11 of 13 \\nSaharsh Rao:  With regards to these molecules obviously these being our custom manufacturing molecules we \\ncannot delve  into any details of these products . But again our strategy with regards to these \\nproducts are varying it could be in some cases where we are the prime and only API supplier. \\nThere are cases where we are the secondary supplier but with a greater than 50% share and there \\nare also cases where we are the secondary supplier with a less than 50% share. All these scenarios \\nare quite possible . But  what I would also like to say is that in most of these molecules we are \\nalways the API supplier . There are not a lot of projects where we are in the intermediate business.  \\nSri Srihari:  Right so I mean how would you position yourself in this I mean basically are you at let  us say \\nare you kind of satisfied with the market shares you have or there is still a lot of scope to go?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  It is a continuous process and I think we would like to keep increasing our market shares for \\nthese m olecules . I would say we would never be satisfied with what kind of a share we have . \\nBut again it really depends on the specific molecule itself because ultimately when we are in the \\ncontract manufacturing space we typically do not offer those molecules to  the generic customer. \\nSo we are working only with the innovator company exclusively.  \\nSri Srihari:  Okay and because the four in clinical stage are they in late Phase -3? \\nSaharsh Rao:  So they are in Phase -2 as well as Phase -3. \\nSri Srihari:  Okay and can you g ive some addressable market size for these four products?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  It would be hard to do it at this moment because we typically do not try to frame market size for \\nthese molecules which are still under clinic because one the data itself is not very cl ear and \\navailable . Second of all there are still a lot of uncertainties that involve before we can actually \\nachieve that market.  \\nSri Srihari:  So at least the therapies to which these four belongs?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  There are actually in there are a couple in CMS space . There is one in cardio vascular and there \\nis one actually which is an antibiotic.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Saravanan Viswanathan  from Unifi Capital. \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nSaravanan Viswanathan : I would like to know the filing pipeline what kind of  and h ow many  DMFs are we likely to file \\nthis year and what is the existing filings?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So we intend to develop 12 to 16 APIs in FY17 for which obviously our strategy would be to \\nfile DM F, CEPs as well as various o ther filings including IDLs if it  is the Chinese market . But  Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 12 of 13 \\nat this point of time we are not very clear in terms of which products will get filed this year or \\nnot. But you can take it that we intend to scale up about 12 to 16.  \\nManagement:  And this include s the CMS APIs as well. So we are talking about the total number of APIs . So \\nsome of them may not even have a DM F and that is why it  is difficult for us to comment the \\nexact number of DM Fs. \\nSaravanan Viswanathan : And as regards to CMS can you broadly give a geographical mix?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So CMS it is still a growing business for the company and therefore the year -to-year mix could \\ndepend on which specific pro jects we are executing . But broadly in a steady state it would be \\ncurrently about 40% US, about 30% in Europe and about 20% to 30% from Japan.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Hareesha Kakkera from BOB Capital Markets. \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nHareesha Kakkera:  Sir, I wanted to know like somewhere in your Annual Reports you happened to men tion like on \\nan average you are going to add 10 to 12 products to the product basket every year. And I want \\nto know what percentage of it would be high value the niche molecules and what percentage it \\ncould be for the CMS? \\nSaharsh Rao:  So Hareesha , generally speaking it  has been the management philosophy to shift the business \\nstrategy from being a prime focused organization to a niche focused organization because \\nultimately we believe that niche is where Neuland\\u2019s capabilities are better utilized . And there \\nare greater opportunities where we are facing less pricing pressure or less pressure from \\ncompetitors in this niche generic space. So as a part of our strategy we have made this conscious \\nmove to focus more on niche generics.  \\nSo as a result of thi s strategy a lot of the focus on the development molecules have been these \\nniche generic APIs and therefore to answer your question it could be envisaged that a significant \\npart or a major part of these molecules would be niche generic APIs . However,  there  would \\nalways be a possibility for us to develop prime APIs if they present the right opportunity and if \\nNeuland can come up with the right technology that gives us that leadership.  \\nHareesha Kakkera:  So can we assume like it could be around 80% of the new additions would be niche molecules?  \\nManagement : Well it is tough to comment on an exact percentage Hareesha because that will keep changing \\nmaybe you could say that one third will still continue to be molecules which would eventually \\nbecome prime . Because a lot of our customers, our old customers keep asking us to develop \\nthose molecules . Another third would be niche and another third would be probably significantly \\nmore niche.  That  is typically how our product portfolio will look like.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 13 of 13 \\nModerator : Thank yo u. As there are no further questions  from the participants , I would now like to hand \\nover the floor to Mr. S ucheth Rao  for his closing comments . Over to you, sir.  \\nSucheth Rao:  So thank you everyone. I thank you for taking the time to joining the call. Again in summary we \\nbelieve that this quarter was a good representation of the growth that we have achieved over the \\nyear. I think going forward we continue to have optimism about our baseline business which is \\nthe prime product as well as the Niche Generics as well as the CMS business. We will continue \\nto have these interactions in our quarterly investor calls. And in the meanwhile should you have \\nany questions or clarifications, p lease do reach out to our investor relations agency, Christensen. \\nI would also like to add thanks to Christensen as well as all our other members who have actually \\nsupported this conference call. Looking forward to our future interactions.  \\nModerator : Thank  you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlem en, on behalf of Neuland Laboratories , that \\nconcludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"STOCK_PRICE\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 565,\n        \"min\": 392,\n        \"max\": 2425,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24,\n        \"samples\": [\n          718\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"STOCK_PRICE_LEAD\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 575.1868849071317,\n        \"min\": 392.0,\n        \"max\": 2425.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23,\n        \"samples\": [\n          392.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"STOCK_PRICE_LAG\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 559.923794927919,\n        \"min\": 392.0,\n        \"max\": 2425.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23,\n        \"samples\": [\n          467.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

As a reminder, all participants\\u2019 lines will be in the listen -only mode and there \\nwill be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need \\nassistance during the conference call, please signal  an operator by pressing \\u2018*\\u2019 then \\u20180\\u2019 on your \\ntouchtone telephone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand \\nthe conference over to Mr. Diwakar Pingle from Christensen IR. Thank you and over to you, sir.  \\nDiwakar Pingle : Welcome everyone and thanks for joining the Q1 FY17 Earnings call for Neuland Laboratories \\nLimited. Please note that the results have been made to you and you can also view this on our \\nwebsite at www.neulandlabs.com.  \\n To take us through the results for thi s quarter to answer your questions we have with us the \\nmanagement represented by Mr. Sucheth Rao, Vice Chairman & CEO; Mr. Saharsh Rao, Joint \\nManaging Director and Anil Kumar who is the CFO.  \\n We will be starting the call with a brief over view given by Sah arsh providing a brief of the \\ncompany\\u2019s performance which will then be followed by Q&A session.  \\n I would like to remind you that everything said on this call may reflects  any outlook for the \\nfuture or which can be constitute as a forward -looking statement. It must be viewed in \\nconjunction with  uncertainties and the risks that we face.  These uncertainties and risks are \\nincluded but not limited to what we have mentioned in our prospectus filed with SEBI and \\nsubsequent annual report which you can find on our website.  \\n With that said, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Saharsh Rao. Over to you, sir.  \\nSaharsh Rao:  Good morning everyone. A warm welcome to all of you who have logged on to this call. Let me \\nstart with the financial first and then move onto some business highlights . For the quarter of Q1 \\nFY17 the total operating income was Rs. 149.77 crores compared to Rs. 123.72 crores for the \\nsame quarter last year representing an increase of 21%. The EBITDA stood at Rs. 25.05 crores \\ncompared to Rs. 21.63 crores for the same quarter of FY16, an increase of 16%.  \\n The EBITDA margin is at 16.7% for Q1 FY17 as against 17.5 % for Q1 FY16. Net profit stood \\nat Rs. 9.71 crores for the quarter as compared to Rs. 7.3 crores for Q1 of last financial year. \\nBasic EPS stood at Rs. 10.93 crores as against Rs. 8.22 crores in Q1 of FY16. If I have to quickly \\ndissect the results the key h ighlights would be our revenues have been the highest in the quarter \\nin the history of the company and that is positive. The EBITDA margins are stable but you must \\nunderstand that the same is the function of the product mix and hence the same has been cons tant \\ncompared to last quarter. When we compare the EBITDA of this quarter with the Q1 of last \\nfiscal there is a difference due to onetime payments that Neuland received from APIC which \\nwere a part of other income in Q1 FY16.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 3 of 13 \\n Other highlights from a busine ss mix perspective about 47% of revenues came from prime \\nproducts, 29% from niche API and the remaining 23% came from CMS business. You would \\nrecall that starting from last quarter onwards management has decided to give the business \\nsaliency information as  well and this breakdown that I just shared is a part of that initiative.  \\n The CMS business also has another highlight continues to see improved traction and from a \\nproject perspective the company is currently working on about 10 projects; 9 in Q4 of FY16 and \\n1 in Q1 of FY16 of which 6 are in commercial stage and 4 are in clinical stage. From an \\noperational perspective some of the key highlights include successfully cleared ANVISA audit \\nfor the unit 2. This is the regulatory agency from Brazil. Also continu ed business momentum in \\nSalmeterol one of the products that we have been talking about as it gets commercialized. We \\nhave added new customers as well as penetrated new markets for this product. Then progress in \\nnew GDS API called Deferasirox with addition of new customers and initiation of supplies for \\nvalidation batches in multiple geographies and also another highlight would be encouraging \\ninitial response from the Chinese pharmaceutical markets where we have initiated sale of several \\nnew APIs.  \\n So to sum marize I think this was a very strong quarter in terms of financial performance as well \\nas the operating parameters. We believe that this momentum will build as we move forward and \\nare cautiously confident of the growth prospects of the company for the fin ancial year.  \\n Having said this, I would like to now throw open the floor to Q&A. Sucheth, Anil and I will try \\nto respond as much as we can. Over to you, Diwakar.  \\nModerator : Thank you  very much, sir . Ladies and gentlem en, we will now begin the question -and-answer \\nsession.  \\nWe have t he first question from the line of Abdul Puranwala from Centrum Broking . Please go \\nahead.  \\nAbdul Puranwala : My first question is regarding the revenue growth . So in Q4 you have stated that there was one \\ndeferred order which has been passed on to Q1 that is the current quarter. So can you tell me \\nwhat would be the actual growth barring that one particular order?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  Abdul , I think there was a reference mad e in the previous quarter that there have been some \\norders which were not fulfilled at the end of Q4 and those would be spilled over to Q1. I think \\nyou are referring to that comment, is that right?  \\nAbdul Puranwala : Yes, sir. \\nSaharsh Rao:  So I think it is fair to comment , Abdul , that in our business there are always going to be orders, \\ndeliveries certain products which are going to fall towards the end of the month or end of a  Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 4 of 13 \\nquarter and invariably it is beyond operations control as to when it will get bil led. So to answer \\nthe question specifically would be very difficult because to be honest we would continue to have \\nthose kind of spillovers of opportunit ies in our normal business . So for example there would be \\norders in Q1 also which we may have originall y plan to have delivered in Q1 but may have \\nspilled over to Q2. So in summary it is not really prudent to look at the impact of that because \\nthe growth that we have achieved we believe is a realistic fundamental growth.  \\nAbdul Puranwala : And my second quest ion would be regarding the Salmeterol, so which new geography have we \\nintroduced Salmeterol?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So these customers are customers within the European region , Abdul, these are probably second \\ntier customers who are going for late launches and they are different countries within Europe as \\nwell as other regions.  \\nAbdul Puranwala : And so for FY 18 we had given previously  a revenue guidance of Rs. 750 crores so do we still \\nmaintain that?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  We have actually never given revenue guidance , Abdul , so not sure where your comment is \\ncoming from.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Hareesha Kakkera from BOB Capital Markets. \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nHareesha Kakkera:  I just wanted to know what is the growth rate in Salmeterol that you have achieved and going \\nahead what could be the growth rate?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  Thanks for the question . We actually have not disclosed growth rate s especially within the \\nproduct individually . So that  is a question that we would not be able to answer.  \\nHareesha Kakker a: And I just wanted to know like which phases of the molecules are you concentrating right now, \\nit seems that it is more of Phase -2 and Phase -3 and are you continuing the same going ahead?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So typically our approach in this CMS business , Haree sha, is to look for opportunities which are \\nin Phase -2, Phase -3 because that is the right time for us to partner as a contract manufacturing \\norganization . But the way we actually visualize our business is that molecules will continue from \\nPhase -2 to Phase -3 and commercialization so over time the number of commercial opportunities \\nwill increase. So that  is the model t hat we are pursuing . Having said that we do pursue \\nopportunity directly in commercial as well . So sometimes we do talk to pharmaceutical \\ncompan ies who already have a commercial molecule and are looking for a second supplier or a \\nthird supplier where Neuland tries to go and enter that role. So there is no clinical part of \\ndevelopment over there where we become directly part of the commercial.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 5 of 13 \\nHare esha Kakkera:  And what are the new geographies you are tapping for the CMS business?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  CMS typically we focus on Europe, North America and Japan these have been predominantly \\nour three main regions . On top of that we do also actively look for opportunities with Indian \\npharmaceutical companies as well. But obviously we have different criteria within these markets \\nwhich I perhaps may not be able to elaborate because of the time limitations.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Amish Kanani from JM Financial. Please go ahead.  \\nAmish Kanani:  Can you give us some flavor of what type of products are we selling under the niche API given \\nthe confidentiality you may not be able to name all of them, but if you can just give us what type \\nof API we are designing as niche, one. And  two, what kind of margins are we getting from that \\nsay vis-\\u00e0-vis a blended margin that we have for their business ? And  third, if you can just also \\nelaborate on this surplus land agreement how much is the land and some flavor on that?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  With regards to niche generic A PIs these are typically molecules which are differentiated either \\nbecause of the method of use of the products . So they are typically they are injectable, APIs are \\ngoing to injectable formula tion, APIs are going to trans dermal  patches or into  inhalation \\nproducts etcetera or another way of defining a niche API would be molecule which is extremely \\ncomplex in nature where chemically it is very challenging to manufacture it. What it means from \\na market point of view for a niche generic A PIs is that the market itself may not be very large \\nbut the opportunity for a company like Neuland to penetrate that market and gain a significant \\nmarket share would be quite high.  \\nSo typically niche generic A PIs would not be very large in terms of turnover topline, but very \\nhigh in terms of margins as well as the market share opportunity for Neuland itself . And we have \\ngiven examples of molecules like Salmeterol , Propofol in the past . There is a molecule called \\nDeferasirox which we talked about in this release . We talked about Paliperidone in the past . \\nThese are all examples of niche generic A PIs. And with regards to margins we would not like to \\ncomment specifically about the margin profile of niche generics but as I mentioned in my earlier \\ncomment these are typically higher margin products compared to our prime products . So \\ntherefore we expect them to contribute positively to the margin of the business.  \\nAnd then finally with your question about Nanakramguda, the property that is being developed \\nwith Phoenix this is actually a joint development agreement . So Neuland actually does not \\ncontribute to any investments into this project this land actually is located in one of the \\ndeveloping parts of the city where a lot of corporate offices are coming up and the developer \\nwould actually build office space which would be shared in the ratio of 23% to 77% \\napproximately. And it  is from Neuland\\u2019s point of view, it is a very positive development because \\nwithout any further inv estments other than what we have done in the past, we will be able to \\nacquire 23% of share.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 6 of 13 \\nAmish Kanani:  So what was the land in terms of acres or square feet sir, if you can share that?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  It is a five-acre plot. \\nAmish Kanani:  And sir , can we a ssume that the niche generic, we have a EBITDA margin in the range of 17%, \\n17.5% . So can we assume that niche generic would be say more than 25% margin?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  It really depends on product -to-product so it would be hard to comment on that.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. We take the next question from the line of Tushar Mundhane from Anand Rathi. \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nTushar Mundhane:  With respect to prime segment, I just would like to understand the volume growth and the pricing \\ngrowth for the quarter?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So I think within the quarter the pri me products have contributed to about 47% of our top line \\nwhich you would imagine is close to about Rs. 70 crores,  Rs. 72 crores. S o this is actually largely \\ndriven by about five or six products which are part of the p rime category. Within these products \\nwe have not really given specific breakdown of products itself . But in terms of general trends it \\nis hard to comment on volume as well as pricing trends together as a group because there are \\nproducts where there is a de clining trend of pricing, there are products where there is price \\nstability and there are products where price is also increasing.  \\nManagement:  But generally overall we do expect that the revenue growth from prime products will not be \\naggressive, it will always be a modest growth because those are products where we have already \\nestablished our market share where the product itself is not growing s ignificantly.  \\nTushar Mundhane : API kind of legacy , API kind of business and say let us say a couple of companies because of \\nthe oil based products with the fall in crude oil prices and all there has been sharp reduction in \\nprices for them because of subseq uent fall in the raw material prices. So is that effect seen in our \\ncase also?  \\nManagement : No, so when we say prime products we are actually referring to Neuland\\u2019s products , right . Prime \\ndoes not mean that they are actually commodity API s. So prime products for us might actually \\nbe very good products for somebody else . So I think we are reasonably insulated from our \\nmargins being significantly impacted by crude oil prices . I think that macro fluctuation in these \\ncommodities impact the price of our so lvent s and some other smaller materials . But I do not see \\nthat they will have a huge impact on the margins of our prime APIs.  \\nTushar Mundhane:  And my second question is with respect to the sequential drop in gross margin, if you can help \\nme understand that ?  Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 7 of 13 \\nManagement : So I would encourage you not to read too much into a quarter to quarter change in the gross \\nmargin or a slight change in the EBITDA margin because that will it is a product with which \\nimpact that and you will see that fluctuation on a quarter -to-quarter basis.  \\nTushar Mundhane:  Because sequentially also we have seen the improvement in the sales contribution from CMS \\nand niche segment despite that we are having the falling gross margin that  is the reason why the \\nquestion?  \\nManagement : Tushar , again gross margins for the quarter is about 53% whereas for the full year of last year it \\nhas been slightly lower, it is about 51%. So for the quarter it is okay, it is fairly compared on a n \\nannualized basis of last year it is okay. It is in line with that o r slightly better.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ashish Rathi from Infina Finance. Please go ahead.  \\nAshish Rathi:  I just wanted to understand if you can we treat this like a base quarter and going ahead can we \\nassume that we will see growth from here onwards, on these numbers?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So I think as I mentioned earlier we think that the growth that we have achieved is a fundamental \\ngrowth . And I think the journey in our business is such that every quarter has a different \\ncharac teristic to it. S o we cannot help you with a clear definition . But I think hopefully that \\nshould give you enough clarity.  \\nAshish Rathi:  Okay and secondly on the margins that the top line is growing good and the margins we have \\nstill in  the band of like 15%  20% odd . We have been indicating around 20% . So should we like \\nwill we be looking as an inflection at some point in time or how should we look at the margins \\ntrajectory going forward ? I mean when do we see actually a continual improvement happening \\nor sho uld we wait for an in junction ? \\nSaharsh Rao:  I do not think there will be an inflection itself , Ashish , but it will be a gradual ramp up in margin \\nas you know the margin the business mix changes and continues to improve as well as \\noperational leverage kicks  in. So we are able to generate more turnover from the same facilit ies. \\nThe combination of these two factors will actually drive the margins . When we will get to a \\ncertain milestone is really dependent on how and when we execute the business mix . So it is \\nhard for us to comment on that but I can tell you that there will not be any inflections, it will be \\na gradual move and it will not be a linear move as well.  \\nAshish Rathi:  Just to add to that in terms of the debt position where are we right now and how sho uld we see \\nthis going ahead, the debt number?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  The debt position if you see it  is about almost like Rs. 175 crores . It is  in terms of net worth we \\nare about Rs. 195 crores . So it is lower than one. T he long term debt is about Rs.  45 crores and \\nthe short term debt is about for the working capital requirement is about Rs.  130 crores.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 8 of 13 \\nAshish Rathi:  So do we intend to  repay this debt or how do we look at it ? Will there be raising further debts or \\nCAPEX will we need that? H ow do we keep the debt syst em moving for the company\\u2019s \\nbasically ? \\nSaharsh Rao:  See if you look at the CAPEX position for the company we said in the last quarters saying that \\nthe CAPEX for the year is about close to about Rs. 22 crores and we would be largely fundi ng \\nit through internal accruals.  \\nManagement:  And in addition to that just an additional comment is see our goal is to keep debt always at a \\nhealthy level . Currently our debt equity is less than 1 so up to about 1.5 to 2 times is considered \\nreasonable and not too risky . So we will always like to keep our debt equity at a very healthy \\nlevel . Working capital will always be around 30% of our overall sales, 2 8% to 30%. So going \\nforward that is how we would like to maintain . Of course there will be changes based on \\nrequirement . It will be up and down but you will see that it will always be maintained at these \\nlevels.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. The n ext question is from the line of Saravanan Viswanathan from Unifi Capital . \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nSaravanan Viswanathan:  I would like to know if Evolven ce has exited from the parent company or they are still the \\nshareholders?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  I think this question has been asked in the previous calls as well . Now since that  is a transaction \\nthat is happening in the holding company we will not elabor ate on it but the process is going on . \\nSo it is not yet complete.  \\nSaravanan Viswanathan:  Okay and in terms of the real estate you had mentioned that it is pertaining to office space, during \\nthis quarter have we received any specific income from this arrang ement in terms of some initial \\nfee or something?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  No, nothing.  \\nSaravanan Viswanathan:  And my last question . So can we assume that we have moved from the Rs. 120 crore s base to \\nRs. 140 crore s base in terms of quarterly revenue s? \\nSaharsh Rao:  That is your assumption to make I have actually just mentioned to one of the previous \\nparticipants that I think this growth is a fundamental growth . But having said that we always \\nhave challenges as a business . But we are quite optimistic about the busines s going forward as \\nwell. But we do not want to give any specific guidance in terms of what  is the base.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ayush Surana from Ethos Capital. Please go ahead.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 9 of 13 \\nAyush Surana:  I just have one question to ask . Have we tied up with an Israeli firm for API contract, are we \\nsupplying to them?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  We cannot comment on any specific products so I am sorry I will not be able to answer that.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Amish Kanani from JM Financial. Please go ahead.  \\nAmish Kanani:  I had a question about given that niche proportion of the business this quarter is reasonably \\nhigher than the last quarter same time, still our EBITDA margins are in the same range . So what \\nwould you attrib ute it to ? So the question is given that prime is lowering and still our margins \\nare in this range, what do we take apart from say product mix which might be the explanation?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  I think in terms of the margins itself it is a factor of multiple it  is actually a combination of \\nmultiple factors . So while the niche generic APIs has increased there are many factors that totally \\nimpact the margin of the business. So it will be hard for us to give you any kind of firm factor \\nas to why the margin has not improved . I think I will go back to my previous comment to say \\nthat as the business mix continues to increase and the operational leverage continues to increase \\nwhich means that as we continue to generate more revenue from our facilities we anticipate that  \\nthe margin will continue to increase.  \\nAmish Kanani:  Sir, in that context what is our operational capitalization if you were to kind of put some number \\nthere?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So we believe that our facilities together we operate two manufacturing facilities t hey put \\ntogether with some maintenance and debottlenecking CAPEX we would be able to generate Rs. \\n750 crores to Rs. 850 crores of revenue given an optimal business mix . And this is something \\nthat could change plus or minus but that is something that we thi nk is possible from our existing \\nfacilities.  \\nAmish Kanani:  So you are saying in that level the margins will improve is what you are saying?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  Yes. \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Vishal Singhania, Retail investor. Please go ahead.  \\nVishal Singhania:  Sir, you had said in the last conference call that you expect to reach full capacity by FY17. So \\ndo you still stand by that?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  We have not mentioned that we would reach full capacity by FY17, we have actually said tha t \\nwe would have to continue to augment capacity. A nd as a part of that Anil had also mentioned \\nin an earlier comment that we will be doing some level of debottlenecking capacity creations  \\nwithin the two facilities.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 10 of 13 \\nVishal Singhania:  Okay sir and the next question is sir, Teva  Pharmaceuticals from the US said that they would be \\nlaunching the Huntington disease  drug in the second half of financial year 2017, in the second \\nhalf of 2017 that is . So do we expect some kind of growth coming in from there as we su pply \\nAPIs for Huntington  series?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So we have actually not mentioned specifically which customers we are working with for which \\nproducts so obviously this is a question that I cannot answer.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line o f Sri Srihari from PCS Securities. Please go ahead.  \\nSri Srihari:  Two questions basically . If you talk about the complex generics space I would like to know what \\nare the meaningful opportunities,  you are looking out for over the next 18 to 24 months ? And \\nsecondly on the custom manufacturing side you mentioned for six commercial molecules you \\nare trying to make an entry there . So what is the kind of market share you might have gained in \\nthose products?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So with regards to the niche generic APIs right now a lot of products comprise this category so \\nwe have talked about Salmeterol, Paliperidone in the past molecules which are a part of this \\ncategory . I think going forward we will continue to strive to launch more products in this \\ncategory and as a result we will hope to commercialize more of them going forward. One of the \\nproducts I mentioned in today\\u2019s call in my opening comments was Deferasirox which is a \\nmolecule again which is a part of this category, very interesting product for which we are lo oking \\nat global market share.  \\nThis is a molecule whose patent expires in 2019 . Again we will not have the time to elaborate a \\nlot of products but there are other  molecules  as well such as Pro pofol, Escitalopram , \\nSuga mmadex, Donepezil  etcetera which are all  part of this category and will continue to have \\ngood opportunities for Neuland going forward. There is also a product called Labetalol  which \\nwe mentioned in our earlier updates as a molecule . That is an old molecule but is being scaled \\nup. Labetalol  is also an example of a niche generic API wherein Neuland is actually trying to \\ncreate a very good market opportunity for a molecule that actually has been generic for quite \\nsome time.  \\nSri Srihari:  And what about Lurasidone ? \\nSaharsh Rao:  That is a molecule whic h is part of our product list, it is still under development . I believe it is \\nstill early to comment on the prospects of it . But we are doing the validation for that molecule \\nthis year.  \\nSri Srihari:  And regards to the six custom manufacturing product s that you mentioned?   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 11 of 13 \\nSaharsh Rao:  With regards to these molecules obviously these being our custom manufacturing molecules we \\ncannot delve  into any details of these products . But again our strategy with regards to these \\nproducts are varying it could be in some cases where we are the prime and only API supplier. \\nThere are cases where we are the secondary supplier but with a greater than 50% share and there \\nare also cases where we are the secondary supplier with a less than 50% share. All these scenarios \\nare quite possible . But  what I would also like to say is that in most of these molecules we are \\nalways the API supplier . There are not a lot of projects where we are in the intermediate business.  \\nSri Srihari:  Right so I mean how would you position yourself in this I mean basically are you at let  us say \\nare you kind of satisfied with the market shares you have or there is still a lot of scope to go?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  It is a continuous process and I think we would like to keep increasing our market shares for \\nthese m olecules . I would say we would never be satisfied with what kind of a share we have . \\nBut again it really depends on the specific molecule itself because ultimately when we are in the \\ncontract manufacturing space we typically do not offer those molecules to  the generic customer. \\nSo we are working only with the innovator company exclusively.  \\nSri Srihari:  Okay and because the four in clinical stage are they in late Phase -3? \\nSaharsh Rao:  So they are in Phase -2 as well as Phase -3. \\nSri Srihari:  Okay and can you g ive some addressable market size for these four products?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  It would be hard to do it at this moment because we typically do not try to frame market size for \\nthese molecules which are still under clinic because one the data itself is not very cl ear and \\navailable . Second of all there are still a lot of uncertainties that involve before we can actually \\nachieve that market.  \\nSri Srihari:  So at least the therapies to which these four belongs?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  There are actually in there are a couple in CMS space . There is one in cardio vascular and there \\nis one actually which is an antibiotic.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Saravanan Viswanathan  from Unifi Capital. \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nSaravanan Viswanathan : I would like to know the filing pipeline what kind of  and h ow many  DMFs are we likely to file \\nthis year and what is the existing filings?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So we intend to develop 12 to 16 APIs in FY17 for which obviously our strategy would be to \\nfile DM F, CEPs as well as various o ther filings including IDLs if it  is the Chinese market . But  Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 12 of 13 \\nat this point of time we are not very clear in terms of which products will get filed this year or \\nnot. But you can take it that we intend to scale up about 12 to 16.  \\nManagement:  And this include s the CMS APIs as well. So we are talking about the total number of APIs . So \\nsome of them may not even have a DM F and that is why it  is difficult for us to comment the \\nexact number of DM Fs. \\nSaravanan Viswanathan : And as regards to CMS can you broadly give a geographical mix?  \\nSaharsh Rao:  So CMS it is still a growing business for the company and therefore the year -to-year mix could \\ndepend on which specific pro jects we are executing . But broadly in a steady state it would be \\ncurrently about 40% US, about 30% in Europe and about 20% to 30% from Japan.  \\nModerator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Hareesha Kakkera from BOB Capital Markets. \\nPlease go ahead.  \\nHareesha Kakkera:  Sir, I wanted to know like somewhere in your Annual Reports you happened to men tion like on \\nan average you are going to add 10 to 12 products to the product basket every year. And I want \\nto know what percentage of it would be high value the niche molecules and what percentage it \\ncould be for the CMS? \\nSaharsh Rao:  So Hareesha , generally speaking it  has been the management philosophy to shift the business \\nstrategy from being a prime focused organization to a niche focused organization because \\nultimately we believe that niche is where Neuland\\u2019s capabilities are better utilized . And there \\nare greater opportunities where we are facing less pricing pressure or less pressure from \\ncompetitors in this niche generic space. So as a part of our strategy we have made this conscious \\nmove to focus more on niche generics.  \\nSo as a result of thi s strategy a lot of the focus on the development molecules have been these \\nniche generic APIs and therefore to answer your question it could be envisaged that a significant \\npart or a major part of these molecules would be niche generic APIs . However,  there  would \\nalways be a possibility for us to develop prime APIs if they present the right opportunity and if \\nNeuland can come up with the right technology that gives us that leadership.  \\nHareesha Kakkera:  So can we assume like it could be around 80% of the new additions would be niche molecules?  \\nManagement : Well it is tough to comment on an exact percentage Hareesha because that will keep changing \\nmaybe you could say that one third will still continue to be molecules which would eventually \\nbecome prime . Because a lot of our customers, our old customers keep asking us to develop \\nthose molecules . Another third would be niche and another third would be probably significantly \\nmore niche.  That  is typically how our product portfolio will look like.   Neuland Laboratories Limited  \\nAugust 16, 2016  \\n \\n Page 13 of 13 \\nModerator : Thank yo u. As there are no further questions  from the participants , I would now like to hand \\nover the floor to Mr. S ucheth Rao  for his closing comments . Over to you, sir.  \\nSucheth Rao:  So thank you everyone. I thank you for taking the time to joining the call. Again in summary we \\nbelieve that this quarter was a good representation of the growth that we have achieved over the \\nyear. I think going forward we continue to have optimism about our baseline business which is \\nthe prime product as well as the Niche Generics as well as the CMS business. We will continue \\nto have these interactions in our quarterly investor calls. And in the meanwhile should you have \\nany questions or clarifications, p lease do reach out to our investor relations agency, Christensen. \\nI would also like to add thanks to Christensen as well as all our other members who have actually \\nsupported this conference call. Looking forward to our future interactions.  \\nModerator : Thank  you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlem en, on behalf of Neuland Laboratories , that \\nconcludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"STOCK_PRICE\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 565,\n        \"min\": 392,\n        \"max\": 2425,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24,\n        \"samples\": [\n          718\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"STOCK_PRICE_LEAD\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 575.1868849071317,\n        \"min\": 392.0,\n        \"max\": 2425.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23,\n        \"samples\": [\n          392.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"STOCK_PRICE_LAG\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 559.923794927919,\n        \"min\": 392.0,\n        \"max\": 2425.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23,\n        \"samples\": [\n          467.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"WORD_COUNT\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1555,\n        \"min\": 4681,\n        \"max\": 11665,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5923\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

ANIL KUMAR \\u2013 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER , NEULAND LABORATORIES LIMITED Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 2 13 Moderator: Ladies gentlemen, good day welcome Newland Laboratories Q1 FY17 E arnings Conference Call. As reminder, all participants\\u2019 lines listen -only mode there an opportunity ask questions after presentation concludes. Should need assistance during conference call, please signal an operator by pressing \\u2018*\\u2019 then \\u20180\\u2019 your touchtone telephone. Please note this conference being recorded. would now like hand conference over Mr. Diwakar Pingle from Christensen IR. Thank over you, sir. Diwakar Pingle : Welcome everyone thanks joining Q1 FY17 Earnings call Neuland Laboratories Limited. Please note results been made can also view this website at www.neulandlabs.com. To take us through results thi s quarter answer your questions with us management represented by Mr. Sucheth Rao, Vice Chairman & CEO; Mr. Saharsh Rao, Joint Managing Director Anil Kumar who CFO. We starting call with brief over view given by Sah arsh providing brief company\\u2019s performance which then followed by Q&A session. would like remind everything said this call may reflects any outlook future or which can constitute forward -looking statement. It must viewed conjunction with uncertainties risks face. These uncertainties risks included but not limited what mentioned prospectus filed with SEBI subsequent annual report which can find website. With said, now turn call over Mr. Saharsh Rao. Over you, sir. Saharsh Rao: Good morning everyone. A warm welcome all who logged this call. Let me start with financial first then move onto some business highlights . For quarter Q1 FY17 total operating income was Rs. 149.77 crores compared Rs. 123.72 crores same quarter last year representing an increase 21%. The EBITDA stood at Rs. 25.05 crores compared Rs. 21.63 crores same quarter FY16, an increase 16%. The EBITDA margin at 16.7% Q1 FY17 against 17.5 % Q1 FY16. Net profit stood at Rs. 9.71 crores quarter compared Rs. 7.3 crores Q1 last financial year. Basic EPS stood at Rs. 10.93 crores against Rs. 8.22 crores Q1 FY16. If quickly dissect results key h ighlights would revenues been highest quarter history company positive. The EBITDA margins stable but must understand same function product mix hence same has been cons tant compared last quarter. When compare EBITDA this quarter with Q1 last fiscal there difference due onetime payments Neuland received from APIC which were part other income Q1 FY16. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 3 13 Other highlights from busine ss mix perspective about 47% revenues came from prime products, 29% from niche API remaining 23% came from CMS business. You would recall starting from last quarter onwards management has decided give business saliency information well this breakdown just shared part initiative. The CMS business also has another highlight continues see improved traction from project perspective company currently working about 10 projects; 9 Q4 FY16 1 Q1 FY16 which 6 commercial stage 4 clinical stage. From an operational perspective some key highlights include successfully cleared ANVISA audit unit 2. This regulatory agency from Brazil. Also continu ed business momentum Salmeterol one products been talking about gets commercialized. We added new customers well penetrated new markets this product. Then progress new GDS API called Deferasirox with addition new customers initiation supplies validation batches multiple geographies also another highlight would encouraging initial response from Chinese pharmaceutical markets where initiated sale several new APIs. So sum marize think this was very strong quarter terms financial performance well operating parameters. We believe this momentum build move forward cautiously confident growth prospects company fin ancial year. Having said this, would like now throw open floor Q&A. Sucheth, Anil try respond much can. Over you, Diwakar. Moderator : Thank very much, sir . Ladies gentlem en, now begin question -and-answer session. We t he first question from line Abdul Puranwala from Centrum Broking . Please go ahead. Abdul Puranwala : My first question regarding revenue growth . So Q4 stated there was one deferred order which has been passed Q1 current quarter. So can tell me what would actual growth barring one particular order? Saharsh Rao: Abdul , think there was reference mad e previous quarter there been some orders which were not fulfilled at end Q4 those would spilled over Q1. think referring comment, right? Abdul Puranwala : Yes, sir. Saharsh Rao: So think fair comment , Abdul , business there always going orders, deliveries certain products which going fall towards end month or end Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 4 13 quarter invariably beyond operations control when get bil led. So answer question specifically would very difficult because honest would continue those kind spillovers opportunit ies normal business . So example there would orders Q1 also which may originall y plan delivered Q1 but may spilled over Q2. So summary not really prudent look at impact because growth achieved believe realistic fundamental growth. Abdul Puranwala : And my second quest ion would regarding Salmeterol, so which new geography introduced Salmeterol? Saharsh Rao: So these customers customers within European region , Abdul, these probably second tier customers who going late launches they different countries within Europe well other regions. Abdul Puranwala : And so FY 18 had given previously revenue guidance Rs. 750 crores so do still maintain that? Saharsh Rao: We actually never given revenue guidance , Abdul , so not sure where your comment coming from. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Hareesha Kakkera from BOB Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hareesha Kakkera: just wanted know what growth rate Salmeterol achieved going ahead what could growth rate? Saharsh Rao: Thanks question . We actually not disclosed growth rate s especially within product individually . So question would not able answer. Hareesha Kakker a: And just wanted know like which phases molecules concentrating right now, seems more Phase -2 Phase -3 continuing same going ahead? Saharsh Rao: So typically approach this CMS business , Haree sha, look opportunities which Phase -2, Phase -3 because right time us partner contract manufacturing organization . But way actually visualize business molecules continue from Phase -2 Phase -3 commercialization so over time number commercial opportunities increase. So model t hat pursuing . Having said do pursue opportunity directly commercial well . So sometimes do talk pharmaceutical compan ies who already commercial molecule looking second supplier or third supplier where Neuland tries go enter role. So there no clinical part development over there where become directly part commercial. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 5 13 Hare esha Kakkera: And what new geographies tapping CMS business? Saharsh Rao: CMS typically focus Europe, North America Japan these been predominantly three main regions . On top do also actively look opportunities with Indian pharmaceutical companies well. But obviously different criteria within these markets which perhaps may not able elaborate because time limitations. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Amish Kanani from JM Financial. Please go ahead. Amish Kanani: Can give us some flavor what type products selling under niche API given confidentiality may not able name all them, but if can just give us what type API designing niche, one. And two, what kind margins getting from say vis-\\u00e0-vis blended margin their business ? And third, if can just also elaborate this surplus land agreement how much land some flavor that? Saharsh Rao: With regards niche generic A PIs these typically molecules which differentiated either because method use products . So they typically they injectable, APIs going injectable formula tion, APIs going trans dermal patches or into inhalation products etcetera or another way defining niche API would molecule which extremely complex nature where chemically very challenging manufacture it. What means from market point view niche generic A PIs market itself may not very large but opportunity company like Neuland penetrate market gain significant market share would quite high. So typically niche generic A PIs would not very large terms turnover topline, but very high terms margins well market share opportunity Neuland itself . And given examples molecules like Salmeterol , Propofol past . There molecule called Deferasirox which talked about this release . We talked about Paliperidone past . These all examples niche generic A PIs. And with regards margins would not like comment specifically about margin profile niche generics but mentioned my earlier comment these typically higher margin products compared prime products . So therefore expect them contribute positively margin business. And then finally with your question about Nanakramguda, property being developed with Phoenix this actually joint development agreement . So Neuland actually does not contribute any investments into this project this land actually located one developing parts city where lot corporate offices coming up developer would actually build office space which would shared ratio 23% 77% approximately. And from Neuland\\u2019s point view, very positive development because without any further inv estments other than what done past, able acquire 23% share. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 6 13 Amish Kanani: So what was land terms acres or square feet sir, if can share that? Saharsh Rao: It five-acre plot. Amish Kanani: And sir , can ssume niche generic, EBITDA margin range 17%, 17.5% . So can assume niche generic would say more than 25% margin? Saharsh Rao: It really depends product -to-product so would hard comment that. Moderator: Thank you. We take next question from line Tushar Mundhane from Anand Rathi. Please go ahead. Tushar Mundhane: With respect prime segment, just would like understand volume growth pricing growth quarter? Saharsh Rao: So think within quarter pri me products contributed about 47% top line which would imagine close about Rs. 70 crores, Rs. 72 crores. S o this actually largely driven by about five or six products which part p rime category. Within these products not really given specific breakdown products itself . But terms general trends hard comment volume well pricing trends together group because there products where there de clining trend pricing, there products where there price stability there products where price also increasing. Management: But generally overall do expect revenue growth from prime products not aggressive, always modest growth because those products where already established market share where product itself not growing s ignificantly. Tushar Mundhane : API kind legacy , API kind business say let us say couple companies because oil based products with fall crude oil prices all there has been sharp reduction prices them because subseq uent fall raw material prices. So effect seen case also? Management : No, so when say prime products actually referring Neuland\\u2019s products , right . Prime does not mean they actually commodity API s. So prime products us might actually very good products somebody else . So think reasonably insulated from margins being significantly impacted by crude oil prices . think macro fluctuation these commodities impact price so lvent s some other smaller materials . But do not see they huge impact margins prime APIs. Tushar Mundhane: And my second question with respect sequential drop gross margin, if can help me understand ? Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 7 13 Management : So would encourage not read too much into quarter quarter change gross margin or slight change EBITDA margin because product with which impact see fluctuation quarter -to-quarter basis. Tushar Mundhane: Because sequentially also seen improvement sales contribution from CMS niche segment despite having falling gross margin reason why question? Management : Tushar , again gross margins quarter about 53% whereas full year last year has been slightly lower, about 51%. So quarter okay, fairly compared n annualized basis last year okay. It line with o r slightly better. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Ashish Rathi from Infina Finance. Please go ahead. Ashish Rathi: just wanted understand if can treat this like base quarter going ahead can assume see growth from here onwards, these numbers? Saharsh Rao: So think mentioned earlier think growth achieved fundamental growth . And think journey business such every quarter has different charac teristic it. S o cannot help with clear definition . But think hopefully should give enough clarity. Ashish Rathi: Okay secondly margins top line growing good margins still band like 15% 20% odd . We been indicating around 20% . So should like looking an inflection at some point time or how should look at margins trajectory going forward ? mean when do see actually continual improvement happening or sho uld wait an junction ? Saharsh Rao: do not think there an inflection itself , Ashish , but gradual ramp up margin know margin business mix changes continues improve well operational leverage kicks in. So able generate more turnover from same facilit ies. The combination these two factors actually drive margins . When get certain milestone really dependent how when execute business mix . So hard us comment but can tell there not any inflections, gradual move not linear move well. Ashish Rathi: Just add terms debt position where right now how sho uld see this going ahead, debt number? Saharsh Rao: The debt position if see about almost like Rs. 175 crores . It terms net worth about Rs. 195 crores . So lower than one. T he long term debt about Rs. 45 crores short term debt about working capital requirement about Rs. 130 crores. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 8 13 Ashish Rathi: So do intend repay this debt or how do look at ? Will there raising further debts or CAPEX need that? H ow do keep debt syst em moving company\\u2019s basically ? Saharsh Rao: See if look at CAPEX position company said last quarters saying CAPEX year about close about Rs. 22 crores would largely fundi ng through internal accruals. Management: And addition just an additional comment see goal keep debt always at healthy level . Currently debt equity less than 1 so up about 1.5 2 times considered reasonable not too risky . So always like keep debt equity at very healthy level . Working capital always around 30% overall sales, 2 8% 30%. So going forward how would like maintain . Of course there changes based requirement . It up down but see always maintained at these levels. Moderator: Thank you. The n ext question from line Saravanan Viswanathan from Unifi Capital . Please go ahead. Saravanan Viswanathan: would like know if Evolven ce has exited from parent company or they still shareholders? Saharsh Rao: think this question has been asked previous calls well . Now since transaction happening holding company not elabor ate but process going . So not yet complete. Saravanan Viswanathan: Okay terms real estate had mentioned pertaining office space, during this quarter received any specific income from this arrang ement terms some initial fee or something? Saharsh Rao: No, nothing. Saravanan Viswanathan: And my last question . So can assume moved from Rs. 120 crore s base Rs. 140 crore s base terms quarterly revenue s? Saharsh Rao: That your assumption make actually just mentioned one previous participants think this growth fundamental growth . But having said always challenges business . But quite optimistic about busines s going forward well. But do not want give any specific guidance terms what base. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Ayush Surana from Ethos Capital. Please go ahead. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 9 13 Ayush Surana: just one question ask . Have tied up with an Israeli firm API contract, supplying them? Saharsh Rao: We cannot comment any specific products so am sorry not able answer that. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Amish Kanani from JM Financial. Please go ahead. Amish Kanani: had question about given niche proportion business this quarter reasonably higher than last quarter same time, still EBITDA margins same range . So what would attrib ute ? So question given prime lowering still margins this range, what do take apart from say product mix which might explanation? Saharsh Rao: think terms margins itself factor multiple actually combination multiple factors . So while niche generic APIs has increased there many factors totally impact margin business. So hard us give any kind firm factor why margin has not improved . think go back my previous comment say business mix continues increase operational leverage continues increase which means continue generate more revenue from facilities anticipate margin continue increase. Amish Kanani: Sir, context what operational capitalization if were kind put some number there? Saharsh Rao: So believe facilities together operate two manufacturing facilities t hey put together with some maintenance debottlenecking CAPEX would able generate Rs. 750 crores Rs. 850 crores revenue given an optimal business mix . And this something could change plus or minus but something thi nk possible from existing facilities. Amish Kanani: So saying level margins improve what saying? Saharsh Rao: Yes. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Vishal Singhania, Retail investor. Please go ahead. Vishal Singhania: Sir, had said last conference call expect reach full capacity by FY17. So do still stand by that? Saharsh Rao: We not mentioned would reach full capacity by FY17, actually said tha t would continue augment capacity. A nd part Anil had also mentioned an earlier comment doing some level debottlenecking capacity creations within two facilities. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 10 13 Vishal Singhania: Okay sir next question sir, Teva Pharmaceuticals from US said they would launching Huntington disease drug second half financial year 2017, second half 2017 . So do expect some kind growth coming from there su pply APIs Huntington series? Saharsh Rao: So actually not mentioned specifically which customers working with which products so obviously this question cannot answer. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line o f Sri Srihari from PCS Securities. Please go ahead. Sri Srihari: Two questions basically . If talk about complex generics space would like know what meaningful opportunities, looking out over next 18 24 months ? And secondly custom manufacturing side mentioned six commercial molecules trying make an entry there . So what kind market share might gained those products? Saharsh Rao: So with regards niche generic APIs right now lot products comprise this category so talked about Salmeterol, Paliperidone past molecules which part this category . think going forward continue strive launch more products this category result hope commercialize more them going forward. One products mentioned today\\u2019s call my opening comments was Deferasirox which molecule again which part this category, very interesting product which lo oking at global market share. This molecule whose patent expires 2019 . Again not time elaborate lot products but there other molecules well such Pro pofol, Escitalopram , Suga mmadex, Donepezil etcetera which all part this category continue good opportunities Neuland going forward. There also product called Labetalol which mentioned earlier updates molecule . That an old molecule but being scaled up. Labetalol also an example niche generic API wherein Neuland actually trying create very good market opportunity molecule actually has been generic quite some time. Sri Srihari: And what about Lurasidone ? Saharsh Rao: That molecule whic h part product list, still under development . believe still early comment prospects . But doing validation molecule this year. Sri Srihari: And regards six custom manufacturing product s mentioned? Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 11 13 Saharsh Rao: With regards these molecules obviously these being custom manufacturing molecules cannot delve into any details these products . But again strategy with regards these products varying could some cases where prime only API supplier. There cases where secondary supplier but with greater than 50% share there also cases where secondary supplier with less than 50% share. All these scenarios quite possible . But what would also like say most these molecules always API supplier . There not lot projects where intermediate business. Sri Srihari: Right so mean how would position yourself this mean basically at let us say kind satisfied with market shares or there still lot scope go? Saharsh Rao: It continuous process think would like keep increasing market shares these m olecules . would say would never satisfied with what kind share . But again really depends specific molecule itself because ultimately when contract manufacturing space typically do not offer those molecules generic customer. So working only with innovator company exclusively. Sri Srihari: Okay because four clinical stage they late Phase -3? Saharsh Rao: So they Phase -2 well Phase -3. Sri Srihari: Okay can g ive some addressable market size these four products? Saharsh Rao: It would hard do at this moment because typically do not try frame market size these molecules which still under clinic because one data itself not very cl ear available . Second all there still lot uncertainties involve before can actually achieve market. Sri Srihari: So at least therapies which these four belongs? Saharsh Rao: There actually there couple CMS space . There one cardio vascular there one actually which an antibiotic. Moderator: Thank you. The next question from line Saravanan Viswanathan from Unifi Capital. Please go ahead. Saravanan Viswanathan : would like know filing pipeline what kind h ow many DMFs likely file this year what existing filings? Saharsh Rao: So intend develop 12 16 APIs FY17 which obviously strategy would file DM F, CEPs well various o ther filings including IDLs if Chinese market . But Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 12 13 at this point time not very clear terms which products get filed this year or not. But can take intend scale up about 12 16. Management: And this include s CMS APIs well. So talking about total number APIs . So some them may not even DM F why difficult us comment exact number DM Fs. Saravanan Viswanathan : And regards CMS can broadly give geographical mix? Saharsh Rao: So CMS still growing business company therefore year -to-year mix could depend which specific pro jects executing . But broadly steady state would currently about 40% US, about 30% Europe about 20% 30% from Japan. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Hareesha Kakkera from BOB Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hareesha Kakkera: Sir, wanted know like somewhere your Annual Reports happened men tion like an average going add 10 12 products product basket every year. And want know what percentage would high value niche molecules what percentage could CMS? Saharsh Rao: So Hareesha , generally speaking has been management philosophy shift business strategy from being prime focused organization niche focused organization because ultimately believe niche where Neuland\\u2019s capabilities better utilized . And there greater opportunities where facing less pricing pressure or less pressure from competitors this niche generic space. So part strategy made this conscious move focus more niche generics. So result thi s strategy lot focus development molecules been these niche generic APIs therefore answer your question could envisaged significant part or major part these molecules would niche generic APIs . However, there would always possibility us develop prime APIs if they present right opportunity if Neuland can come up with right technology gives us leadership. Hareesha Kakkera: So can assume like could around 80% new additions would niche molecules? Management : Well tough comment an exact percentage Hareesha because keep changing maybe could say one third still continue molecules which would eventually become prime . Because lot customers, old customers keep asking us develop those molecules . Another third would niche another third would probably significantly more niche. That typically how product portfolio look like. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 13 13 Moderator : Thank yo u. As there no further questions from participants , would now like hand over floor Mr. S ucheth Rao his closing comments . Over you, sir. Sucheth Rao: So thank everyone. thank taking time joining call. Again summary believe this quarter was good representation growth achieved over year. think going forward continue optimism about baseline business which prime product well Niche Generics well CMS business. We continue these interactions quarterly investor calls. And meanwhile should any questions or clarifications, p lease do reach out investor relations agency, Christensen. would also like add thanks Christensen well all other members who actually supported this conference call. Looking forward future interactions. Moderator : Thank very much, sir. Ladies gentlem en, behalf Neuland Laboratories , concludes this conference call.

ANIL KUMAR \\u2013 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER , NEULAND LABORATORIES LIMITED Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 2 13 Moderator: Ladies gentlemen, good day welcome Newland Laboratories Q1 FY17 E arnings Conference Call. As reminder, all participants\\u2019 lines listen -only mode there an opportunity ask questions after presentation concludes. Should need assistance during conference call, please signal an operator by pressing \\u2018*\\u2019 then \\u20180\\u2019 your touchtone telephone. Please note this conference being recorded. would now like hand conference over Mr. Diwakar Pingle from Christensen IR. Thank over you, sir. Diwakar Pingle : Welcome everyone thanks joining Q1 FY17 Earnings call Neuland Laboratories Limited. Please note results been made can also view this website at www.neulandlabs.com. To take us through results thi s quarter answer your questions with us management represented by Mr. Sucheth Rao, Vice Chairman & CEO; Mr. Saharsh Rao, Joint Managing Director Anil Kumar who CFO. We starting call with brief over view given by Sah arsh providing brief company\\u2019s performance which then followed by Q&A session. would like remind everything said this call may reflects any outlook future or which can constitute forward -looking statement. It must viewed conjunction with uncertainties risks face. These uncertainties risks included but not limited what mentioned prospectus filed with SEBI subsequent annual report which can find website. With said, now turn call over Mr. Saharsh Rao. Over you, sir. Saharsh Rao: Good morning everyone. A warm welcome all who logged this call. Let me start with financial first then move onto some business highlights . For quarter Q1 FY17 total operating income was Rs. 149.77 crores compared Rs. 123.72 crores same quarter last year representing an increase 21%. The EBITDA stood at Rs. 25.05 crores compared Rs. 21.63 crores same quarter FY16, an increase 16%. The EBITDA margin at 16.7% Q1 FY17 against 17.5 % Q1 FY16. Net profit stood at Rs. 9.71 crores quarter compared Rs. 7.3 crores Q1 last financial year. Basic EPS stood at Rs. 10.93 crores against Rs. 8.22 crores Q1 FY16. If quickly dissect results key h ighlights would revenues been highest quarter history company positive. The EBITDA margins stable but must understand same function product mix hence same has been cons tant compared last quarter. When compare EBITDA this quarter with Q1 last fiscal there difference due onetime payments Neuland received from APIC which were part other income Q1 FY16. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 3 13 Other highlights from busine ss mix perspective about 47% revenues came from prime products, 29% from niche API remaining 23% came from CMS business. You would recall starting from last quarter onwards management has decided give business saliency information well this breakdown just shared part initiative. The CMS business also has another highlight continues see improved traction from project perspective company currently working about 10 projects; 9 Q4 FY16 1 Q1 FY16 which 6 commercial stage 4 clinical stage. From an operational perspective some key highlights include successfully cleared ANVISA audit unit 2. This regulatory agency from Brazil. Also continu ed business momentum Salmeterol one products been talking about gets commercialized. We added new customers well penetrated new markets this product. Then progress new GDS API called Deferasirox with addition new customers initiation supplies validation batches multiple geographies also another highlight would encouraging initial response from Chinese pharmaceutical markets where initiated sale several new APIs. So sum marize think this was very strong quarter terms financial performance well operating parameters. We believe this momentum build move forward cautiously confident growth prospects company fin ancial year. Having said this, would like now throw open floor Q&A. Sucheth, Anil try respond much can. Over you, Diwakar. Moderator : Thank very much, sir . Ladies gentlem en, now begin question -and-answer session. We t he first question from line Abdul Puranwala from Centrum Broking . Please go ahead. Abdul Puranwala : My first question regarding revenue growth . So Q4 stated there was one deferred order which has been passed Q1 current quarter. So can tell me what would actual growth barring one particular order? Saharsh Rao: Abdul , think there was reference mad e previous quarter there been some orders which were not fulfilled at end Q4 those would spilled over Q1. think referring comment, right? Abdul Puranwala : Yes, sir. Saharsh Rao: So think fair comment , Abdul , business there always going orders, deliveries certain products which going fall towards end month or end Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 4 13 quarter invariably beyond operations control when get bil led. So answer question specifically would very difficult because honest would continue those kind spillovers opportunit ies normal business . So example there would orders Q1 also which may originall y plan delivered Q1 but may spilled over Q2. So summary not really prudent look at impact because growth achieved believe realistic fundamental growth. Abdul Puranwala : And my second quest ion would regarding Salmeterol, so which new geography introduced Salmeterol? Saharsh Rao: So these customers customers within European region , Abdul, these probably second tier customers who going late launches they different countries within Europe well other regions. Abdul Puranwala : And so FY 18 had given previously revenue guidance Rs. 750 crores so do still maintain that? Saharsh Rao: We actually never given revenue guidance , Abdul , so not sure where your comment coming from. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Hareesha Kakkera from BOB Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hareesha Kakkera: just wanted know what growth rate Salmeterol achieved going ahead what could growth rate? Saharsh Rao: Thanks question . We actually not disclosed growth rate s especially within product individually . So question would not able answer. Hareesha Kakker a: And just wanted know like which phases molecules concentrating right now, seems more Phase -2 Phase -3 continuing same going ahead? Saharsh Rao: So typically approach this CMS business , Haree sha, look opportunities which Phase -2, Phase -3 because right time us partner contract manufacturing organization . But way actually visualize business molecules continue from Phase -2 Phase -3 commercialization so over time number commercial opportunities increase. So model t hat pursuing . Having said do pursue opportunity directly commercial well . So sometimes do talk pharmaceutical compan ies who already commercial molecule looking second supplier or third supplier where Neuland tries go enter role. So there no clinical part development over there where become directly part commercial. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 5 13 Hare esha Kakkera: And what new geographies tapping CMS business? Saharsh Rao: CMS typically focus Europe, North America Japan these been predominantly three main regions . On top do also actively look opportunities with Indian pharmaceutical companies well. But obviously different criteria within these markets which perhaps may not able elaborate because time limitations. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Amish Kanani from JM Financial. Please go ahead. Amish Kanani: Can give us some flavor what type products selling under niche API given confidentiality may not able name all them, but if can just give us what type API designing niche, one. And two, what kind margins getting from say vis-\\u00e0-vis blended margin their business ? And third, if can just also elaborate this surplus land agreement how much land some flavor that? Saharsh Rao: With regards niche generic A PIs these typically molecules which differentiated either because method use products . So they typically they injectable, APIs going injectable formula tion, APIs going trans dermal patches or into inhalation products etcetera or another way defining niche API would molecule which extremely complex nature where chemically very challenging manufacture it. What means from market point view niche generic A PIs market itself may not very large but opportunity company like Neuland penetrate market gain significant market share would quite high. So typically niche generic A PIs would not very large terms turnover topline, but very high terms margins well market share opportunity Neuland itself . And given examples molecules like Salmeterol , Propofol past . There molecule called Deferasirox which talked about this release . We talked about Paliperidone past . These all examples niche generic A PIs. And with regards margins would not like comment specifically about margin profile niche generics but mentioned my earlier comment these typically higher margin products compared prime products . So therefore expect them contribute positively margin business. And then finally with your question about Nanakramguda, property being developed with Phoenix this actually joint development agreement . So Neuland actually does not contribute any investments into this project this land actually located one developing parts city where lot corporate offices coming up developer would actually build office space which would shared ratio 23% 77% approximately. And from Neuland\\u2019s point view, very positive development because without any further inv estments other than what done past, able acquire 23% share. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 6 13 Amish Kanani: So what was land terms acres or square feet sir, if can share that? Saharsh Rao: It five-acre plot. Amish Kanani: And sir , can ssume niche generic, EBITDA margin range 17%, 17.5% . So can assume niche generic would say more than 25% margin? Saharsh Rao: It really depends product -to-product so would hard comment that. Moderator: Thank you. We take next question from line Tushar Mundhane from Anand Rathi. Please go ahead. Tushar Mundhane: With respect prime segment, just would like understand volume growth pricing growth quarter? Saharsh Rao: So think within quarter pri me products contributed about 47% top line which would imagine close about Rs. 70 crores, Rs. 72 crores. S o this actually largely driven by about five or six products which part p rime category. Within these products not really given specific breakdown products itself . But terms general trends hard comment volume well pricing trends together group because there products where there de clining trend pricing, there products where there price stability there products where price also increasing. Management: But generally overall do expect revenue growth from prime products not aggressive, always modest growth because those products where already established market share where product itself not growing s ignificantly. Tushar Mundhane : API kind legacy , API kind business say let us say couple companies because oil based products with fall crude oil prices all there has been sharp reduction prices them because subseq uent fall raw material prices. So effect seen case also? Management : No, so when say prime products actually referring Neuland\\u2019s products , right . Prime does not mean they actually commodity API s. So prime products us might actually very good products somebody else . So think reasonably insulated from margins being significantly impacted by crude oil prices . think macro fluctuation these commodities impact price so lvent s some other smaller materials . But do not see they huge impact margins prime APIs. Tushar Mundhane: And my second question with respect sequential drop gross margin, if can help me understand ? Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 7 13 Management : So would encourage not read too much into quarter quarter change gross margin or slight change EBITDA margin because product with which impact see fluctuation quarter -to-quarter basis. Tushar Mundhane: Because sequentially also seen improvement sales contribution from CMS niche segment despite having falling gross margin reason why question? Management : Tushar , again gross margins quarter about 53% whereas full year last year has been slightly lower, about 51%. So quarter okay, fairly compared n annualized basis last year okay. It line with o r slightly better. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Ashish Rathi from Infina Finance. Please go ahead. Ashish Rathi: just wanted understand if can treat this like base quarter going ahead can assume see growth from here onwards, these numbers? Saharsh Rao: So think mentioned earlier think growth achieved fundamental growth . And think journey business such every quarter has different charac teristic it. S o cannot help with clear definition . But think hopefully should give enough clarity. Ashish Rathi: Okay secondly margins top line growing good margins still band like 15% 20% odd . We been indicating around 20% . So should like looking an inflection at some point time or how should look at margins trajectory going forward ? mean when do see actually continual improvement happening or sho uld wait an junction ? Saharsh Rao: do not think there an inflection itself , Ashish , but gradual ramp up margin know margin business mix changes continues improve well operational leverage kicks in. So able generate more turnover from same facilit ies. The combination these two factors actually drive margins . When get certain milestone really dependent how when execute business mix . So hard us comment but can tell there not any inflections, gradual move not linear move well. Ashish Rathi: Just add terms debt position where right now how sho uld see this going ahead, debt number? Saharsh Rao: The debt position if see about almost like Rs. 175 crores . It terms net worth about Rs. 195 crores . So lower than one. T he long term debt about Rs. 45 crores short term debt about working capital requirement about Rs. 130 crores. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 8 13 Ashish Rathi: So do intend repay this debt or how do look at ? Will there raising further debts or CAPEX need that? H ow do keep debt syst em moving company\\u2019s basically ? Saharsh Rao: See if look at CAPEX position company said last quarters saying CAPEX year about close about Rs. 22 crores would largely fundi ng through internal accruals. Management: And addition just an additional comment see goal keep debt always at healthy level . Currently debt equity less than 1 so up about 1.5 2 times considered reasonable not too risky . So always like keep debt equity at very healthy level . Working capital always around 30% overall sales, 2 8% 30%. So going forward how would like maintain . Of course there changes based requirement . It up down but see always maintained at these levels. Moderator: Thank you. The n ext question from line Saravanan Viswanathan from Unifi Capital . Please go ahead. Saravanan Viswanathan: would like know if Evolven ce has exited from parent company or they still shareholders? Saharsh Rao: think this question has been asked previous calls well . Now since transaction happening holding company not elabor ate but process going . So not yet complete. Saravanan Viswanathan: Okay terms real estate had mentioned pertaining office space, during this quarter received any specific income from this arrang ement terms some initial fee or something? Saharsh Rao: No, nothing. Saravanan Viswanathan: And my last question . So can assume moved from Rs. 120 crore s base Rs. 140 crore s base terms quarterly revenue s? Saharsh Rao: That your assumption make actually just mentioned one previous participants think this growth fundamental growth . But having said always challenges business . But quite optimistic about busines s going forward well. But do not want give any specific guidance terms what base. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Ayush Surana from Ethos Capital. Please go ahead. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 9 13 Ayush Surana: just one question ask . Have tied up with an Israeli firm API contract, supplying them? Saharsh Rao: We cannot comment any specific products so am sorry not able answer that. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Amish Kanani from JM Financial. Please go ahead. Amish Kanani: had question about given niche proportion business this quarter reasonably higher than last quarter same time, still EBITDA margins same range . So what would attrib ute ? So question given prime lowering still margins this range, what do take apart from say product mix which might explanation? Saharsh Rao: think terms margins itself factor multiple actually combination multiple factors . So while niche generic APIs has increased there many factors totally impact margin business. So hard us give any kind firm factor why margin has not improved . think go back my previous comment say business mix continues increase operational leverage continues increase which means continue generate more revenue from facilities anticipate margin continue increase. Amish Kanani: Sir, context what operational capitalization if were kind put some number there? Saharsh Rao: So believe facilities together operate two manufacturing facilities t hey put together with some maintenance debottlenecking CAPEX would able generate Rs. 750 crores Rs. 850 crores revenue given an optimal business mix . And this something could change plus or minus but something thi nk possible from existing facilities. Amish Kanani: So saying level margins improve what saying? Saharsh Rao: Yes. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Vishal Singhania, Retail investor. Please go ahead. Vishal Singhania: Sir, had said last conference call expect reach full capacity by FY17. So do still stand by that? Saharsh Rao: We not mentioned would reach full capacity by FY17, actually said tha t would continue augment capacity. A nd part Anil had also mentioned an earlier comment doing some level debottlenecking capacity creations within two facilities. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 10 13 Vishal Singhania: Okay sir next question sir, Teva Pharmaceuticals from US said they would launching Huntington disease drug second half financial year 2017, second half 2017 . So do expect some kind growth coming from there su pply APIs Huntington series? Saharsh Rao: So actually not mentioned specifically which customers working with which products so obviously this question cannot answer. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line o f Sri Srihari from PCS Securities. Please go ahead. Sri Srihari: Two questions basically . If talk about complex generics space would like know what meaningful opportunities, looking out over next 18 24 months ? And secondly custom manufacturing side mentioned six commercial molecules trying make an entry there . So what kind market share might gained those products? Saharsh Rao: So with regards niche generic APIs right now lot products comprise this category so talked about Salmeterol, Paliperidone past molecules which part this category . think going forward continue strive launch more products this category result hope commercialize more them going forward. One products mentioned today\\u2019s call my opening comments was Deferasirox which molecule again which part this category, very interesting product which lo oking at global market share. This molecule whose patent expires 2019 . Again not time elaborate lot products but there other molecules well such Pro pofol, Escitalopram , Suga mmadex, Donepezil etcetera which all part this category continue good opportunities Neuland going forward. There also product called Labetalol which mentioned earlier updates molecule . That an old molecule but being scaled up. Labetalol also an example niche generic API wherein Neuland actually trying create very good market opportunity molecule actually has been generic quite some time. Sri Srihari: And what about Lurasidone ? Saharsh Rao: That molecule whic h part product list, still under development . believe still early comment prospects . But doing validation molecule this year. Sri Srihari: And regards six custom manufacturing product s mentioned? Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 11 13 Saharsh Rao: With regards these molecules obviously these being custom manufacturing molecules cannot delve into any details these products . But again strategy with regards these products varying could some cases where prime only API supplier. There cases where secondary supplier but with greater than 50% share there also cases where secondary supplier with less than 50% share. All these scenarios quite possible . But what would also like say most these molecules always API supplier . There not lot projects where intermediate business. Sri Srihari: Right so mean how would position yourself this mean basically at let us say kind satisfied with market shares or there still lot scope go? Saharsh Rao: It continuous process think would like keep increasing market shares these m olecules . would say would never satisfied with what kind share . But again really depends specific molecule itself because ultimately when contract manufacturing space typically do not offer those molecules generic customer. So working only with innovator company exclusively. Sri Srihari: Okay because four clinical stage they late Phase -3? Saharsh Rao: So they Phase -2 well Phase -3. Sri Srihari: Okay can g ive some addressable market size these four products? Saharsh Rao: It would hard do at this moment because typically do not try frame market size these molecules which still under clinic because one data itself not very cl ear available . Second all there still lot uncertainties involve before can actually achieve market. Sri Srihari: So at least therapies which these four belongs? Saharsh Rao: There actually there couple CMS space . There one cardio vascular there one actually which an antibiotic. Moderator: Thank you. The next question from line Saravanan Viswanathan from Unifi Capital. Please go ahead. Saravanan Viswanathan : would like know filing pipeline what kind h ow many DMFs likely file this year what existing filings? Saharsh Rao: So intend develop 12 16 APIs FY17 which obviously strategy would file DM F, CEPs well various o ther filings including IDLs if Chinese market . But Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 12 13 at this point time not very clear terms which products get filed this year or not. But can take intend scale up about 12 16. Management: And this include s CMS APIs well. So talking about total number APIs . So some them may not even DM F why difficult us comment exact number DM Fs. Saravanan Viswanathan : And regards CMS can broadly give geographical mix? Saharsh Rao: So CMS still growing business company therefore year -to-year mix could depend which specific pro jects executing . But broadly steady state would currently about 40% US, about 30% Europe about 20% 30% from Japan. Moderator: Thank you. Next question from line Hareesha Kakkera from BOB Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hareesha Kakkera: Sir, wanted know like somewhere your Annual Reports happened men tion like an average going add 10 12 products product basket every year. And want know what percentage would high value niche molecules what percentage could CMS? Saharsh Rao: So Hareesha , generally speaking has been management philosophy shift business strategy from being prime focused organization niche focused organization because ultimately believe niche where Neuland\\u2019s capabilities better utilized . And there greater opportunities where facing less pricing pressure or less pressure from competitors this niche generic space. So part strategy made this conscious move focus more niche generics. So result thi s strategy lot focus development molecules been these niche generic APIs therefore answer your question could envisaged significant part or major part these molecules would niche generic APIs . However, there would always possibility us develop prime APIs if they present right opportunity if Neuland can come up with right technology gives us leadership. Hareesha Kakkera: So can assume like could around 80% new additions would niche molecules? Management : Well tough comment an exact percentage Hareesha because keep changing maybe could say one third still continue molecules which would eventually become prime . Because lot customers, old customers keep asking us develop those molecules . Another third would niche another third would probably significantly more niche. That typically how product portfolio look like. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 13 13 Moderator : Thank yo u. As there no further questions from participants , would now like hand over floor Mr. S ucheth Rao his closing comments . Over you, sir. Sucheth Rao: So thank everyone. thank taking time joining call. Again summary believe this quarter was good representation growth achieved over year. think going forward continue optimism about baseline business which prime product well Niche Generics well CMS business. We continue these interactions quarterly investor calls. And meanwhile should any questions or clarifications, p lease do reach out investor relations agency, Christensen. would also like add thanks Christensen well all other members who actually supported this conference call. Looking forward future interactions. Moderator : Thank very much, sir. Ladies gentlem en, behalf Neuland Laboratories , concludes this conference call.

The EBITDA stood Rs. 25.05 crores compared Rs. 21.63 crores quarter FY16, increase 16%. The EBITDA margin 16.7% Q1 FY17 17.5 % Q1 FY16. Net profit stood Rs. 9.71 crores quarter compared Rs. 7.3 crores Q1 last financial year. Basic EPS stood Rs. 10.93 crores Rs. 8.22 crores Q1 FY16. If quickly dissect results key h ighlights would revenues highest quarter history company positive. The EBITDA margins stable must understand function product mix hence cons tant compared last quarter. When compare EBITDA quarter Q1 last fiscal difference due onetime payments Neuland received APIC part income Q1 FY16. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 3 13 Other highlights busine ss mix perspective 47% revenues came prime products, 29% niche API remaining 23% came CMS business. You would recall starting last quarter onwards management decided give business saliency information well breakdown shared part initiative. The CMS business also another highlight continues see improved traction project perspective company currently working 10 projects; 9 Q4 FY16 1 Q1 FY16 6 commercial stage 4 clinical stage. From operational perspective key highlights include successfully cleared ANVISA audit unit 2. This regulatory agency Brazil. Also continu ed business momentum Salmeterol one products talking gets commercialized. We added new customers well penetrated new markets product. Then progress new GDS API called Deferasirox addition new customers initiation supplies validation batches multiple geographies also another highlight would encouraging initial response Chinese pharmaceutical markets initiated sale several new APIs. So sum marize think strong quarter terms financial performance well operating parameters. We believe momentum build move forward cautiously confident growth prospects company fin ancial year. Having said this, would like throw open floor Q&A. Sucheth, Anil try respond much can. Over you, Diwakar. Moderator : Thank much, sir . Ladies gentlem en, begin question -and-answer session. We first question line Abdul Puranwala Centrum Broking . Please go ahead. Abdul Puranwala : My first question regarding revenue growth . So Q4 stated one deferred order passed Q1 current quarter. So tell would actual growth barring one particular order? Saharsh Rao: Abdul , think reference mad e previous quarter orders fulfilled end Q4 would spilled Q1. think referring comment, right? Abdul Puranwala : Yes, sir. Saharsh Rao: So think fair comment , Abdul , business always going orders, deliveries certain products going fall towards end month end Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 4 13 quarter invariably beyond operations control get bil led. So answer question specifically would difficult honest would continue kind spillovers opportunit ies normal business . So example would orders Q1 also may originall plan delivered Q1 may spilled Q2. So summary really prudent look impact growth achieved believe realistic fundamental growth. Abdul Puranwala : And second quest ion would regarding Salmeterol, new geography introduced Salmeterol? Saharsh Rao: So customers customers within European region , Abdul, probably second tier customers going late launches different countries within Europe well regions. Abdul Puranwala : And FY 18 given previously revenue guidance Rs. 750 crores still maintain that? Saharsh Rao: We actually never given revenue guidance , Abdul , sure comment coming from. Moderator: Thank you. Next question line Hareesha Kakkera BOB Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hareesha Kakkera: wanted know growth rate Salmeterol achieved going ahead could growth rate? Saharsh Rao: Thanks question . We actually disclosed growth rate especially within product individually . So question would able answer. Hareesha Kakker a: And wanted know like phases molecules concentrating right now, seems Phase -2 Phase -3 continuing going ahead? Saharsh Rao: So typically approach CMS business , Haree sha, look opportunities Phase -2, Phase -3 right time us partner contract manufacturing organization . But way actually visualize business molecules continue Phase -2 Phase -3 commercialization time number commercial opportunities increase. So model hat pursuing . Having said pursue opportunity directly commercial well . So sometimes talk pharmaceutical compan ies already commercial molecule looking second supplier third supplier Neuland tries go enter role. So clinical part development become directly part commercial. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 5 13 Hare esha Kakkera: And new geographies tapping CMS business? Saharsh Rao: CMS typically focus Europe, North America Japan predominantly three main regions . On top also actively look opportunities Indian pharmaceutical companies well. But obviously different criteria within markets perhaps may able elaborate time limitations. Moderator: Thank you. Next question line Amish Kanani JM Financial. Please go ahead. Amish Kanani: Can give us flavor type products selling niche API given confidentiality may able name them, give us type API designing niche, one. And two, kind margins getting say vis-\\u00e0-vis blended margin business ? And third, also elaborate surplus land agreement much land flavor that? Saharsh Rao: With regards niche generic A PIs typically molecules differentiated either method use products . So typically injectable, APIs going injectable formula tion, APIs going trans dermal patches inhalation products etcetera another way defining niche API would molecule extremely complex nature chemically challenging manufacture it. What means market point view niche generic A PIs market may large opportunity company like Neuland penetrate market gain significant market share would quite high. So typically niche generic A PIs would large terms turnover topline, high terms margins well market share opportunity Neuland . And given examples molecules like Salmeterol , Propofol past . There molecule called Deferasirox talked release . We talked Paliperidone past . These examples niche generic A PIs. And regards margins would like comment specifically margin profile niche generics mentioned earlier comment typically higher margin products compared prime products . So therefore expect contribute positively margin business. And finally question Nanakramguda, property developed Phoenix actually joint development agreement . So Neuland actually contribute investments project land actually located one developing parts city lot corporate offices coming developer would actually build office space would shared ratio 23% 77% approximately. And Neuland\\u2019s point view, positive development without inv estments done past, able acquire 23% share. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 6 13 Amish Kanani: So land terms acres square feet sir, share that? Saharsh Rao: It five-acre plot. Amish Kanani: And sir , ssume niche generic, EBITDA margin range 17%, 17.5% . So assume niche generic would say 25% margin? Saharsh Rao: It really depends product -to-product would hard comment that. Moderator: Thank you. We take next question line Tushar Mundhane Anand Rathi. Please go ahead. Tushar Mundhane: With respect prime segment, would like understand volume growth pricing growth quarter? Saharsh Rao: So think within quarter pri products contributed 47% top line would imagine close Rs. 70 crores, Rs. 72 crores. S actually largely driven five six products part p rime category. Within products really given specific breakdown products . But terms general trends hard comment volume well pricing trends together group products de clining trend pricing, products price stability products price also increasing. Management: But generally overall expect revenue growth prime products aggressive, always modest growth products already established market share product growing ignificantly. Tushar Mundhane : API kind legacy , API kind business say let us say couple companies oil based products fall crude oil prices sharp reduction prices subseq uent fall raw material prices. So effect seen case also? Management : No, say prime products actually referring Neuland\\u2019s products , right . Prime mean actually commodity API s. So prime products us might actually good products somebody else . So think reasonably insulated margins significantly impacted crude oil prices . think macro fluctuation commodities impact price lvent smaller materials . But see huge impact margins prime APIs. Tushar Mundhane: And second question respect sequential drop gross margin, help understand ? Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 7 13 Management : So would encourage read much quarter quarter change gross margin slight change EBITDA margin product impact see fluctuation quarter -to-quarter basis. Tushar Mundhane: Because sequentially also seen improvement sales contribution CMS niche segment despite falling gross margin reason question? Management : Tushar , gross margins quarter 53% whereas full year last year slightly lower, 51%. So quarter okay, fairly compared n annualized basis last year okay. It line r slightly better. Moderator: Thank you. Next question line Ashish Rathi Infina Finance. Please go ahead. Ashish Rathi: wanted understand treat like base quarter going ahead assume see growth onwards, numbers? Saharsh Rao: So think mentioned earlier think growth achieved fundamental growth . And think journey business every quarter different charac teristic it. S cannot help clear definition . But think hopefully give enough clarity. Ashish Rathi: Okay secondly margins top line growing good margins still band like 15% 20% odd . We indicating around 20% . So like looking inflection point time look margins trajectory going forward ? mean see actually continual improvement happening sho uld wait junction ?

So result thi strategy lot focus development molecules niche generic APIs therefore answer question could envisaged significant part major part molecules would niche generic APIs . However, would always possibility us develop prime APIs present right opportunity Neuland come right technology gives us leadership. Hareesha Kakkera: So assume like could around 80% new additions would niche molecules? Management : Well tough comment exact percentage Hareesha keep changing maybe could say one third still continue molecules would eventually become prime . Because lot customers, old customers keep asking us develop molecules . Another third would niche another third would probably significantly niche. That typically product portfolio look like.

The GDS prime segment growth driven uring year product Levetiracetam , Levofloxacin Mirtazapine along APIs. While specialty APIs also seen good growth driven Dorzolamide , Deferasirox Donepezil . However, profitability suboptimal year due surprise increase raw material cost unexpectedly remain firm part year. Also CMS business performance expectations, also created pressure profitability.

Apart since strong technology focused company , also using develop processes , efficient compete lower labour cost, strength technology. However, able scale products need Unit III really position comment exact impact would be, supply protection point view slight advantage margin.

Going forward expectation overall free cash flow positive FY2020 given see revenues going well overall profitability improving nd therefore better off; however, also important understand Company also QIP FY2019 objective QIP essentially invest capital expenditure , so, free cash flow post capex look different way purely free cash flow coming positive, capex coming internal accruals idea QIP money invested capital expenditure activities. Also look overal l liquidity, working capital limit today close Rs.200 - 210 Cores utilization anywhere range Rs.140 - 150 Crores sitting cash balance around Rs.35 Crores , think eno ugh liquidity system . hope answered question appropriately clarify . Deepak Jain : Yes, asking ROCE cost capital , two figures please FY2019 least going fo rward, return capital employed weighted ave rage cost capital? Amit Agarwal: Return capital employed gone profitability low right now, concept effective capital employed, net goodwill, close 6%, suboptimal given profitability low also acquired Unit III investment till close Rs.160 - 165 Crores start yielding results end FY2020 FY2021 see real impact Unit III coming in, think till time ROCE continue suboptimal right second point ?

Moderator: We move next question line Suresh Burramasetty Cogencis . Please go ahead. Suresh Burramasetty : Good afternoon Sir. Sir inves tor Sir. Last time also participated conference. Neuland Laborato ries Limited May 17, 2019 Page 7 14 Davuluri S ucheth Rao: Yes heard question Suresh , benefit others listening, repeat question . asked question CMS business stated na specific molecule, think repeat Saharsh said past, given nature business cannot talk specific molecules sell molecules customer names trade secrets talking information viol ating confidentiality agreements, also making public trade secrets Neuland organization are, would request refrain asking information w hich could compromise position Company, gene ral questions growth CMS mix GDS business cost sales growth strategy happy answer it. Suresh Burramasetty : From quarter expect CMS business growth?

If look Neuland business 7 -8 years ago EBITDA margins used 12% range assumed EBITDA margin prime category. The CMS well speciality busine ss significantly higher margins, margins also determined specific mix projects products quarter, definitely hi gher range, cannot give specific number that.

Abdulkader Puranwala : Last quarter , one ou r Niche molecules generic entered, wanted understand started receiving orders front visibility now? Davuluri Saharsh Rao: Which molecule referring Abdul ? Abdulkader Puranwala : Salmeterol US. Davuluri Saharsh Rao: So think us Salmeterol ry important product Niche category Abdul right several customers supplying material regards US market also several customers plans commercially supplying product fac customers also launched different formulations, different filings, etc., answer question currently seeing asonable uptakes Salmeterol market see kind surge, also given short cycle manufacture product also think possible deman could pickup anytime now, terms planning bee n conservative assumed quantities Salmeterol ar e seeing concrete orders customers also information US market, Neuland also active Europe market know European laun ches happened years ago, seeing volume uptake well, rightly said US big market generic Salmeterol, hoping part generic market well. Abdulkader Puranwala : Also wanted know going invest thing Unit III, earlier guidance almost capex around Rs.200 Crores Rs.100 towards acquisition Rs.100 Crores towards refurbishment plant, still going spend something there? Davuluri Sahar sh Rao: See Abdul, think investment Unit III talked previously also necessary us transform facility largely intermediate facility full fledged API facilit transition period intend use actively intermediate manufacturing facility backward integration well contract manufacturing, Amit responded question earlier gentleman already made certain investments facility n order make suitable backward integration . Notwithstanding investment, continue make investment next 1 2 months going forward future well , quantu timing investments also largely determined projects molecules intend scale up. There certain generic APIs plans scale for. There also certain contract manufacturing projects require large volume manufacturing, whic h looking site for, exact determination capex probably become clearer move Neuland Laborato ries Limited May 17, 2019 Page 9 14 forward. think outlook given ballpark number give invest ors broad sense much investment needed making full-fledged API plant. Abdulkader Puranwala : Okay , thanks one question debt, acquisition mounted Rs.231 Crores, would start seeing decline debt levels, take one two years figure start come operating longer time? Davuluri Sucheth Rao: So Abdul sense made strategic decision internally say debt free company, think organization maintain healthy level debt lot opportunities market us grow organization . If see grown 26% year -on-year compared last year Saharsh saying earlier goa l, expe ctation grow anything 15% 20% year -on-year though may linear growth, therefore, think whatever required us invest back business con tinue do. While extremely frugal terms spend money managing debt levels way ensure healthy cash flows without increasing risks organization. Abdulkader Puranwala : Sure. Thank muc h answering questions. Moderator: Thank . The ne xt question line Surajit Pal Prabhudas Lilladher. Please go ahead. Surajit Pal : Thanks opportunity . One thing clear previous questions supply Salmeterol API US, currently supply Salmeter ol API US? Davuluri Saharsh Rao: So Surajit let give little bit background still try answer question . Salmeterol product filed various customers US market well European market . We und erstand one customer received approval currently active market. Neuland confirming supplying indirectly confirm whether work cu stomer not. Answering question violates whatever confidentiality agreements customers specifics . From GDS molecules perspective , Surajit , happy talk specifically molecule performin g whether Levetiracetam Salmeterol . However, talking Levetiracetam particular customer Salmeterol particular customer violates confidentiality agreements them. In case CMS business, lot difficult cannot even reve al name molecule. In case GDS business least reveal name molecule, unfortunately cannot talk whether work customer not. The reason ifficult us answer question confirms denies whether work someone, reason cannot answe r question directly hope understand. Neuland Laborato ries Limited May 17, 2019 Page 10 14 Surajit Pal : Sure going numbers sh owing pretty sure understan ding supply currently there, though said one client supply Salmeterol US. But currently definitely given numbers, disclosing look like supply Salmetero l US. My second question increase API prices, per come peak stable certain extent, still uncertain impacted EBITDA margin quite lot last one year, think ha chance improvement next four quarters ? Davuluri Sucheth Rao: Generally seeing Surajit market might also read news three four weeks ago exp losion China killed 62 pe ople; therefore, situation China continues volatile know made strategic decision backward integrate protect overall business . hTerefore, Amit saying opening comments Saharsh saying well situation better, sign say things go back normal terms pricing well supply China; therefore, continue backward integrate, continue find alternate sources , c protect ourself, situation still slightly volatile . Surajit Pal : Thanks opportunity. Moderator: Thank . The next question line Anirudh Shetty Solidarity Investment Managers . Please go ahead. Anirudh Shetty : What peak capacity current facilities kind revenues generate peak capacit ies? Davuluri Saharsh Rao : Anirudh, three f acilities currently right now, Unit I, Unit II, olde r facilities Unit III, recently acquired . Between Unit Unit II optim al product mix good mix Niche speciality APIs, CMS well prim e APIs could potentially go high Rs.1,000 Crores jus two facilities. However, situation also subject business pans therefore number could lower Rs.1000 Crores. With Unit III facility coming in, also important understand , relatively larger site potential us add additional production suites equip additional production suite s, increase turnover. With regards facility potential f us go relatively much higher turnover may even Rs.500 Crores something like , depends products decide add, kind volumes add. If add certain prime products, high volume, relative ly low pricing, facility might get occupied, might able add kind capacity, may broad answer would be, may get Rs.1 ,400 – 1,500 Crores revenues three facilities, yes also indicated past would require least Rs.200 Crores plus capex may even depending complexity molecules. Neuland Laborato ries Limited May 17, 2019 Page 11 14 Anirudh Shetty : To answer earlier question mentioned EBITDA steady state basis somewhere give take 18% 19%, go hrough numbers FY2017 EBITDA 17% product mix could improve going forward plus Unit III kick in, case EBITDA expand far higher 18% - 19% conservative realistic estimate? Davuluri Sa harsh Rao : think 18% - 19% feel conservative estimate Anirudh based kind visibility seeing also trying factor surge expenses, investments, things like that. However, think rightly said seen 17% EBI TDA business even two years ago business 17% largely healthy mix CMS, Niche well prime. think goal really make sure bri ng right mix also mentioning openin g remarks , confident CMS business bounce back FY2020, pretty strong order book even entering year happens along growth specia lty segment , see big surprises raw material side like saw last year think getting 17%, 18% even 19% much possible long -term continue pursuit complex molecules like peptide c omplex chemistries actively adding project CMS portfolio well generics portfolio margins climbing even closer 20 also possible. However, think given kind volatility seen busi ness prefer stay little bit conservative sid e, intention really take EBITDA margin even higher 20% possible. Anirudh Shetty : see export benefits P&L Rs.15 Crores FY2018, could please tell nature export benefits sustainable think are? Amit Agarwal : These export benefits various schemes specific Pharma compan ies, exporters hey continue ballpark depending much w e export, currently let us say direct exports 70% turnover, extent benefits continue. Anirudh Shetty : Okay, got . Thank answering quest ions. Moderator: Thank . We take last question fro line Anant Patel , Individual Investor . Please go ahead. Anant Patel : My question related raw material price increase. D ue China raw material price get increased, b ut ability pass increase price c ustomers lag, may three months six months? Neuland Laborato ries Limited May 17, 2019 Page 12 14 Davuluri Saharsh Rao : The challenge face raw material prices ability transfer customers, given tha operate mostly regulated market like Europe, North America, Latin America, etc. The number active DMFS particular product number API supplies customer would qualify product therefore period th ree six months may nine months , sustained incre ase raw material prices across industry possible pass price increase formulat or. However , also important understand even regulat ed markets always three four active API players competitors, pass raw material increase customer whether pass 100% increase pass partial increase determines pri cing compared players market determines whether able pass fully also way even able pass fully impact profitability percentage produ ct, general landscape example products able pass 100% increase, example able pass 20% 30% increase. Anant Patel : This pass unable increase related CMS product related N iche API? Davuluri S ucheth Rao: Yes mostly related GDS prime products Anant, rest unaffected , Saharsh said time lag takes time pass on, cases successful, cases not. Moderator: Thank . Ladies gentlemen, take next question line Kunal Mehta last question today Varnium Capital . Please go ahea d. Kunal Mehta : wanted understand single question operating certain molecules, call us non -Niche, volume -based molecules . Wanted understand last two years seen difficult competitive situation tho se molecules like Ciprofloxacin, situation improved now, able secure somewhat competitive shares customers wanted understand update that? Davuluri Saharsh Rao : That good question Kunal talked bout previous interaction breakup busi ness prime, specialty , well CMS business say want de -emphasize one category rsus other, strategically focus increasing volumes market share prime APIs, continue part strategy future time focus also increasing share CMS business well speciality APIs overall mix. It also happens sometimes take business order grow market share even though margins may attractive temporarily short -term confiden ce able take adequate steps increase overall margins . As k now, API player especially generic business market share volume well growth existing well Neuland Laborato ries Limited May 17, 2019 Page 13 14 new customers gives us competitive advantage future conscious part strategy. Kunal Meh ta: Sure, followup question this, would guid e one take, one assume trajectory growth segment business . Would throw light that? Davuluri Saharsh Rao : So give spe cific number within category Kunal th become confusing track cannot control especially comes quarter -to- quarter basis. However, target grow segments aggressively see lot opportunities prime specialty API business , developed lot capabilities well CMS business, see overall pie grow ing also see segments taking larger share pie position business Kunal. Moderator: Thank . Ladies gentlemen last question. hand conference Mr. Davuluri Sucheth Rao closing comments. Thank Sir. Davuluri Sucheth Rao : Ladies gentlemen, thank joining call. spe ak behalf us really enjoyed interaction, enjoyed questions asking business . think responsibility create much transparency th e business possible able und erstand Neuland, trying expected grow future.

SARADA BHAMIDIPATI - COMPANY SECRETARY , NEULAND LABORATORIES LIMITED Neuland Laboratories Limited September 11, 2017 Page 2 13 Moderator: Good day, l adies gentlemen warm welcome Neuland Laboratories Limited Q1 FY18 Earnings Conference Call. As reminder, participant lines listen -only mode. There opportunity ask questions presentation concludes. Should need ass istance conference call, may signal operator pressing * 0 touchtone phone. Please note conference recorded. hand conference Mr. Diwakar Pingle Christensen IR. Thank you, sir. Diwakar Pingle: Thanks, Ali. Welcome thanks joining Q1 FY18 earnings call Neuland Laboratories. Please note emailed press release everyone also see results website well stock ex change. To take us results quarter answer questions, us management Mr. Sucheth Rao, Vice Chairman CEO; Mr. Saharsh Rao, Joint Managing Director; Mr. Kumar Gupta, AVP Finance Ms. Sarada Bhamidipati Company Secretary. We starting call brief overview Saharsh performance company, followed Q&A session. would like remind everyone everything said call reflects outlook fut ure construed forward looking statement must viewed conjunction uncertainties risks face. These risks unpredictable limited mention prospectus filed wi th SEBI subsequent annual report find website. With said, transfer call Saharsh. Over you. Saharsh Rao: Thank you, Diwakar. Good evening friends. Warm welcome joining call. first touch upon standalone numbers quarter follow business highlights. Total income Rs. 120.1 crores Q1 FY18 compared Rs. 152 crores Q1 FY17, represents decrease 21%. EBITDA stood Rs. 13.3 crores co mpared Rs. 25 crores period previous year 47%. EBITDA margin 11.1% Q1 FY18 16.5% Q1 FY17. Net profit Rs. 2.24 crores compared Rs. 9.45 crores corresponding quarter, decrease 76% basic EPS stood Rs. 2.59 Rs. 10.7 Q1 FY17. So let get highlighting key issues bearing numbers particular quarter. One key issues quarter related mismatch order inflow versus capacity constraints, company prepared specific execution plans quarter, order inflow match plan. This one -off quarter plan play according sc ript. We stronger usual orders products like Donepezil, Olanzapine, Sotalol Levofloxacin, capacity constraints. Products like Salmeterol, Entacapone, Dorzolamide Brinzolamide niche cat egory showed decline order inflow. This direct bearing Neuland Laboratories Limited September 11, 2017 Page 3 13 operational efficiencies hence topline numbers took severe beating may observed, completely internal issue, also extraneous fac tors working us quarter. GST one factors may guessed. You would understand 25% products go domestic customers hence given uncertainty around GST, shipment curtailed cu stomers. Also Forex terms translation losses approximately Rs. 5 crores added headwinds. Our average FX conversion rate last quarter previous year 67.3 compared 64.98 quarter. In last earnings call May, mentioned US FDA inspection conducted. This also followed EDQM inspection also immediately that. The good part inspection US FDA inspection already received EIR EDQM spection, critical major observations. The downside inspection products kept operation proposed inspection impact scheduling therefore impact overall delivery per formance quarter. Having said that, confident future holds us. We seeing good traction CMS business terms new projects. There high customer interest Peptides completed significant mi lestones two peptide projects recent quarter. Our process engineering lab commissioned recently enabling us work quality design new chemical entity projects already helping us across GDS business well CMS business. Also, update status merger that, almost final stretches approvals received update soon completed. To summarize, tepid quarter even internal standards take cognizance same. The good thing exactly know issues behind drop taking steps address future quarters. We confident hopeful see momentum developing ward end year strong note. would like throw floor open Q&A. Moderator: Thank much. Ladies gentlemen, begin question answer session. We take first question line Pri tesh Chheda Lucky Investment Managers. Please go ahead. Pritesh Chheda: Sir, quite perplexed Q4 said spillover orders executed, delivered end quarter 4 was, guess announced around Jun e, wondering topline number. So could throw light? Second Neuland years seen consistency delivery revenue execution side. So wish strengthen it, second question nd third question look mix quarter, know mix also deteriorated far much niche CMS seems fallen much higher revenue fall itself. So way molecules moving towards commercial stage? Neuland Laboratories Limited September 11, 2017 Page 4 13 Sucheth Rao: So Pritesh, good question. It actually 3 different questions. So attempt answer every one those. So think absolutely right, far Q4 last year concerned, spillover Q1 independent Harsh mentioned opening remarks, impact Q1 appreciation rupee well unscheduled inspections including change product mix capacity match. So obviously factors impacted equally Q1 is. Having said that, think one steps taking ensure building adequate buffer capacity Neuland ensure kind variations whether spillover previous quarter rescheduling either inspections unfavorable product mix handled without significantly impacting quarter future. However, aligning capacities creat ing 20% buffer capacity can’t done immediate turn. It take us one two quarters point enough capacity created kind variations taken care of. Having said that, think past b een clear Pritesh expect quarter -to-quarter variability given that… Pritesh Chheda: But sir variability far significant case even understand quarter -to-quarter variability. Sucheth Rao: So said think exp ect quarter -to-quarter variability continue. Our CMS pipeline obviously built up. We expect get point CMS pipeline mature enough kind variability actually reduce, currently build ing CMS pipeline much larger level. We executed 11 projects quarter similar number projects executed previous quarters. So said think primary message right variabi lity make sure adequate capacity, adequate buffer capacity well work strengthening pipeline don’t see much quarter -to-quarter visibility. Thanks. Moderator: Thank you. We take next question fro line Ashish Rathi Spark Capital. Please go ahead. Ashish Rathi: Just following previous participant itself. mean, many months advance order book visibility? mean, little difficult understand products gone would generally client contracts already place them. They would generally new contracts, may incremental orders would come. But sort variation, ju st want sense far order book visibility, say standing today order book far visibility have? Sucheth Rao: So typically Ashish work call rolling plan. Earlier used 3 - month rolli ng plan whereas sales business development people work forecasting orders requirement customers. We extended rolling plan period 6 - month rolling plan, able preempt potential issues come variability. However, 3 6 month rolling plan, point time, let us say rolling Neuland Laboratories Limited September 11, 2017 Page 5 13 plan period starts 1st September end February, six month rolling plan. Typically 30% 40% orders actually confirmed punched system. Rest rolling plan becomes concrete time goes by. So customers keep coming telling us placing orders based confirmed requirements end quarter tha rolling plan actually becomes firm rolling plan completely converted POs. But typically beginning rolling plan period, 30% -40% orders actually confirmed rest orders actually flow system. Ashish Rathi: So happens, mean able deliver asked possibly surplus capacities drug required. So going forward say second quarter, mismatch correc ted? So see incremental sales orders missed? Saharsh Rao: So think one way us ensure mismatch minimized think actually two ways us address mismatch Ashish. One flexibl e manufacturing side, changes made rolling plan customers something able accommodate short notice. think context that, one things happening customers give us certain e stimate forecast next 6 months 9 months, sometimes either preponing requirements postponing requirements ability manufacturing side buffer capacities agile enough cope wit h requirement one action need take. Second part much better job working customers get detail specific delivery dates etc. one area need work. Sucheth Rao: And specific ctions going back question Ashish, done last 3 months products feel need create buffer capacity volatility, mismatch sales capacity actually qualified manufacturing side alternate manufacturing side products. So done order make sure actually overcome changes market, products manufacture unit I, qualified unit II alternate side one gives us additional capacity second also enables manage mismatch sales capacity planning. So things, one things referring earlier that, concrete steps taken, repeat alternate side qualified supply sides. Ashish Rathi: Right. So obviously lost higher margin product say niche pr oducts basically Dorzolamide Brinzolamide maybe Salmeterol, So sense understanding year, actually see EBITDA margin able maintain say last year difficult seen kind first quarter seen? Neuland Laboratories Limited September 11, 2017 Page 6 13 Saharsh Rao: So think Ashish regards sales revenue, try understand, think also question asked earlier gentlemen, see quarter sales largely driven prime products obvious ly lot degrowth come many niche products extent CMS orders originally would anticipated come Q1 didn’t happen. But reason exceedingly concerned many products whether Dorzolamide, Salmeterol etc. understood specific customers specific products none customers actually either dropping product buying suppliers. Their timelines placing orders changed unfortunately us come impacted us significant way. So think specific orders like Dorzolamide, Salmeterol etc. overall basis plans products year future remain intact exceedingly concerned fact punched in. But yes, impacted overall mix prime products dominating two segments muted compar ison previous quarters. Moderator: Thank you. We take next question line Rashmi Sancheti Anand Rathi. Please go ahead. Rashmi Sancheti: Can quantify like, due order mismatch, much CS lost al quantify much impact due GST well Forex translation? Saharsh Rao: So think regards quantification factors Rashmi, mentioned opening remarks, think Forex approximately l ost 5 crores terms realization 67.3 65. For factors, exact quantification approximately range. Sucheth Rao: So build Rashmi, estimated impact G ST minimum 5-7 crores, however, conversations customers like going tell us postponing shipments, delaying shipments GST, right? And cannot really expect cu stomers tell us exactly impacting decision making. So haven’t really quantified can’t accurate something sure off. We know GST implication range 5 -7 crores. It could b e slightly that, based information have. Rashmi Sancheti: And order mismatch, want understand properly. So said products manufactured got postponed order inflow products, right? Saharsh Rao: So order mismatch essentially means first quarter Rashmi, envisaged certain mix business happen result visualization, planned manufacturing. What happened got orders products capacity Neuland Laboratories Limited September 11, 2017 Page 7 13 constraints got less orders products didn’t capacity constraints. So mean say mismatch. Sucheth Rao: So therefore Rashmi, going repeat order balance way doesn’t impact us significantly quarter, taking two steps. One, qualified side products expect higher increase volumes able supply products sides, kind constraint taken care of. We also making conscious effort build buffer capacity little bit high rate capacity, migh increase expenses temporarily ensure able service orders reduce volatility. Going back Ashish’s question earlier, products, customers literally buy us exclusively. They either one source even two sources typically Neuland gets 80% volumes. So high value products Dorzolamide Salmeterol, expect quarter -to-quarter impact long term business less intact cause customer buy API us unless lost market share highly unlikely did, would aware that. And reason think short term impact rather long term im plication. hope makes sense. Rashmi Sancheti: Sir Q3 FY17, said orders got deferred coming subsequent quarters, least products supplies quarter Q1 FY18? Saharsh Rao: think largely speaking think many orders split quarter perhaps next quarter well, Rashmi. think keep active track orders got deferred, man already factored think results Q1 represent factoring orders also may filled subsequent quarters well. But answer yes, factored in. Rashmi Sanc heti: Okay. So annual basis see 15% -16% kind growth niche segment CMS segment 20% annual basis, FY18, consider next 3 quarters, orders coming order mismatch getting correc ted? Sucheth Rao: See inconceivable, Rashmi. Because tell you, though revenue point view, prime products still 50% total revenue mix. would say effort today contract manufactur ing business well specialty API business referred niche business. So therefore since effort focused area expect areas continue grow strongly impact quarter -to-quarter cannot certain about, expect areas grow. Rashmi Sancheti: Okay. Now talking annual basis, FY18 FY17? Neuland Laboratories Limited September 11, 2017 Page 8 13 Saharsh Rao: No. think Sucheth indicated, think overall basis aid inconceivable, think specific point view think expect second half reasonably strong. think Q2 definitely path towards recovery. So seen Q1 extremely disappointing perform ance think clearly acknowledged opening remarks think also clearly indicated reason think also mentioned opening remarks focused addressing reasons. think Q2 wi create break away seen. But think H2 really represent strong growth us. think kind put us back terms momentum had. And think overall basis, think posting small reasonabl e growth FY18 FY17 something definitely inconceivable. Moderator: Thank you. The next question Ranvir Singh Systematix Shares Stocks. Please go ahead. Ranvir Singh: Can indicate performance research uni getting merged quarter? Saharsh Rao: So Ranvir, think process advanced stage. Right now, case hearing NCLT bench Hyderabad, understand bench already reviewed case believe outstanding questions queries. However received kind formal verdict anything like NCLT. So think terms process itself, may hoping next couple weeks sho uld receive formal merger order NCLT subsequent initiate process getting stock companies listed completion merger. So think everything put together maybe still looking 6 8 weeks entire process go through, right seem like course. Ranvir Singh: No. My question performance, sales profit quarter? Saharsh Rao: So think NPRPL, finalized numbers us right now, Ranvir. But share soon ready. Ranvir Singh: Just, positive, negative, could highlight some? Sucheth Rao: Ranvir, numbers audited yet, better comment n audit, reviewed. Once reviewed make information available. Ranvir Singh: And reasons gave weaker performance quarter also impacted CMS business, CMS business also considerably down, might reason? Saharsh Rao: So think regards overall business, right. The CMS business also impacted quarter largely get adequate number orders CMS molecule. think one reason. We executed lot CMS projects quarter, Neuland Laboratories Limited September 11, 2017 Page 9 13 small scale NPRPL level. But commercial CMS orders quarter low. Honestly speaking, real issue concern sid e, terms timing requirements. So many commercial CMS customers placed orders later year. We didn’t many orders Q1, said overall outlook CMS, excited w today strong pipeline CMS projects. indicated opening remarks also, terms peptides also got two exciting projects Japan. We also looking couple interest projects came ur way US market well. But yes, think terms commercial, see matters comes looking revenue salience NLL level commercial CMS revenue coming component low Q1, overall CMS business represented also terms number projects executed projects initiated looking quite positive us. Ranvir Singh: So terms number projects, much different. It 11 -10-12 think, revenue line very… So like commercial projects discontinued mix changed, reason? Saharsh Rao: No Ranvir. So commercial projects CMS initiated continuing grow. So ac tually concerns terms either discontinuation even de -growth. So fact projects continue look strong only. What seeing terms number projects contributing 11 projects year, number may seem positive lot CMS projects initiated still NPRPL level. The salience number shared many CMS projects manufactured plant. But projects initiated today sti NPRPL eventually come plant probably next 2 3 quarters. think pipeline encouraging us. Ranvir Singh: And so, net -to-net FY18, internal ambition revenue revised Q1 session? Saharsh Rao: So think one tangible area relooked revenue, Ranvir, Forex front. think us look, know majority income US dollars. When look FY17 versus FY18, realization FY18 mu ch higher. So making revision terms number. Other that, think minor adjustments doing. But revenue loss seen Q1 permanent nature. They either ismatches due lack buffer capacities certain product line actions taking up. So see long term loss revenue. Sucheth Rao: So add Ranvir, feel impact permanent nature, Forex anything else, definitely going recalibrating revenue, projections, budget whole year feel related delivery mismatch capacity eventually orders get serviced, unit II activated, Neuland Laboratories Limited September 11, 2017 Page 10 13 deliveries started unit II, inventories made waiting license able dispatch product. So reflected sales, right? There h ad need calibrate budgets projection, impact feel, dispassionate going back saying, listen, let us assume calibrated based that. Ranvir Singh: Fine. So quar ter increase inventory seen raw material mostly related prime niche? Saharsh Rao: It largely related prime only. Ranvir Singh: Okay. For CAPEX requirement, CAPEX planning FY18? Saharsh Rao: With e xisting facility don’t require additional CAPEX except maintenance around 15 -20 crores incurring towards CAPEX. Sucheth Rao: So total CAPEX budgeted Ranvir year 61 crores. Out 61 crores, 25 crores budge ted one specific project comes through. So conditional CAPEX, get spend project comes actually commercialized. So notwithstanding that, remove 61, remove 25 crores CAP EX budgeted replacement CAPEX well increasing capacity, upgradation facility, staying -to-date FDA well EDQM standard 61 minus 24 crores. Ranvir Singh: So sometime back talked acquiring API facility, budget that? Sucheth Rao: No. This budget doesn’t include Ranvir. Those plans still intact. At point, haven’t finalized plan exactly going fund expansion, expansion, whatever strategy that, still intact still continue move forward it. Ranvir Singh: And 25 crores said specific projects, require per month CAPEX, fixed asset inventory making something? This CAPEX only? Sucheth Rao: Fixed asset. Ranvir Singh: Okay. So expect commercial supplies NCE year? Saharsh Rao: think couple projects initiated think pipeline current CMS projects also looking strong Ranvir, fact seeing good traction projects, molecules launched last couple years, seeing customers come back additional indication actually reaffirm forecast given. So actually today stand, think next two years outlook CMS business strengthening Neuland Laboratories Limited September 11, 2017 Page 11 13 certain additional quant ities, additional forecast coming, think addition seeing good traction Japan market also. As think shareholders analysts aware, focusing Japan market last 10 year so. But think n last 6 months particular seen good traction specifically area peptides two CMS projects initiated Japan market actually fast track, one fast track clinica l trial. So think molecules looking promising. So see commercialization possibilities them. But even high value nature projects even prior commercialization supplying clinical trial l ater year early next year also extremely attractive. So think lot effort team increase pipeline CMS project think one points would like reiterate today still believe nascent CMS business. We hardly 8 9 molecules giving us stable commercial revenue. For us, one objective make sure manage 8 9 molecules give revenue working careful ly clients also making sure supplying increased quantities new indications etc. The second objective work CMS project. think infrastructure creating like QbD lab etc. w ill help us create better alignment customers commercialization new projects also happen. And think continues happen, revenue growth think start accelerate think volatilities continue bother us eventually get behind us. Moderator: Thank you. We take next question line C Sri Hari PCS Securities. Please go ahead. C Sri Hari : Now talking CMS pipeline again, mentioned 4 projec ts particular, 2 Japan 2 US. presume one Japanese projects Phase -III. So could please highlight one? And mention 2 projects US, one includes Teva molecule ? Thank you. Saharsh Rao: Thanks question C Sri Hari . With regards molecules currently excited about, think two mentioned Japan. think two actually, one fast track molecule, clarify Phase -III believe, somewhere earlier part clinic, fast track. Again think, get specific give sense metabolic diseases area. So diabetes drug large volume high value product. The reason engaging customer certain technical areas established credibility customer wants us apply technologies molecule. Although Japanese customer, drug developed worldwide consumption perhaps 5 7 years plans go per vision could potentially new class diabetes drug. But got lot clinical milestones ahead it. So don’t really factor lot revenue coming unless overcomes clinical milestone. But reason explained molecule detail every quarter trying add molecules, early part Neuland Laboratories Limited September 11, 2017 Page 12 13 clinic also sometime later part clinic.

The CMS business also another highlight continues see improved traction project perspective company currently working 10 projects; 9 Q4 FY16 1 Q1 FY16 6 commercial stage 4 clinical stage. From operational perspective key highlights include successfully cleared ANVISA audit unit 2. This regulatory agency Brazil. Also continu ed business momentum Salmeterol one products talking gets commercialized. We added new customers well penetrated new markets product. Then progress new GDS API called Deferasirox addition new customers initiation supplies validation batches multiple geographies also another highlight would encouraging initial response Chinese pharmaceutical markets initiated sale several new APIs. So sum marize think strong quarter terms financial performance well operating parameters. We believe momentum build move forward cautiously confident growth prospects company fin ancial year. Having said this, would like throw open floor Q&A. Sucheth, Anil try respond much can. Over you, Diwakar. Moderator : Thank much, sir . Ladies gentlem en, begin question -and-answer session. We first question line Abdul Puranwala Centrum Broking . Please go ahead. Abdul Puranwala : My first question regarding revenue growth . So Q4 stated one deferred order passed Q1 current quarter. So tell would actual growth barring one particular order? Saharsh Rao: Abdul , think reference mad e previous quarter orders fulfilled end Q4 would spilled Q1. think referring comment, right? Abdul Puranwala : Yes, sir. Saharsh Rao: So think fair comment , Abdul , business always going orders, deliveries certain products going fall towards end month end Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 4 13 quarter invariably beyond operations control get bil led. So answer question specifically would difficult honest would continue kind spillovers opportunit ies normal business . So example would orders Q1 also may originall plan delivered Q1 may spilled Q2. So summary really prudent look impact growth achieved believe realistic fundamental growth. Abdul Puranwala : And second quest ion would regarding Salmeterol, new geography introduced Salmeterol? Saharsh Rao: So customers customers within European region , Abdul, probably second tier customers going late launches different countries within Europe well regions. Abdul Puranwala : And FY 18 given previously revenue guidance Rs. 750 crores still maintain that? Saharsh Rao: We actually never given revenue guidance , Abdul , sure comment coming from. Moderator: Thank you. Next question line Hareesha Kakkera BOB Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hareesha Kakkera: wanted know growth rate Salmeterol achieved going ahead could growth rate? Saharsh Rao: Thanks question . We actually disclosed growth rate especially within product individually . So question would able answer. Hareesha Kakker a: And wanted know like phases molecules concentrating right now, seems Phase -2 Phase -3 continuing going ahead? Saharsh Rao: So typically approach CMS business , Haree sha, look opportunities Phase -2, Phase -3 right time us partner contract manufacturing organization . But way actually visualize business molecules continue Phase -2 Phase -3 commercialization time number commercial opportunities increase. So model hat pursuing . Having said pursue opportunity directly commercial well . So sometimes talk pharmaceutical compan ies already commercial molecule looking second supplier third supplier Neuland tries go enter role. So clinical part development become directly part commercial. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 5 13 Hare esha Kakkera: And new geographies tapping CMS business? Saharsh Rao: CMS typically focus Europe, North America Japan predominantly three main regions . On top also actively look opportunities Indian pharmaceutical companies well. But obviously different criteria within markets perhaps may able elaborate time limitations. Moderator: Thank you. Next question line Amish Kanani JM Financial. Please go ahead. Amish Kanani: Can give us flavor type products selling niche API given confidentiality may able name them, give us type API designing niche, one. And two, kind margins getting say vis-\\u00e0-vis blended margin business ? And third, also elaborate surplus land agreement much land flavor that? Saharsh Rao: With regards niche generic A PIs typically molecules differentiated either method use products . So typically injectable, APIs going injectable formula tion, APIs going trans dermal patches inhalation products etcetera another way defining niche API would molecule extremely complex nature chemically challenging manufacture it. What means market point view niche generic A PIs market may large opportunity company like Neuland penetrate market gain significant market share would quite high. So typically niche generic A PIs would large terms turnover topline, high terms margins well market share opportunity Neuland . And given examples molecules like Salmeterol , Propofol past . There molecule called Deferasirox talked release . We talked Paliperidone past . These examples niche generic A PIs. And regards margins would like comment specifically margin profile niche generics mentioned earlier comment typically higher margin products compared prime products . So therefore expect contribute positively margin business. And finally question Nanakramguda, property developed Phoenix actually joint development agreement . So Neuland actually contribute investments project land actually located one developing parts city lot corporate offices coming developer would actually build office space would shared ratio 23% 77% approximately. And Neuland\\u2019s point view, positive development without inv estments done past, able acquire 23% share. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 6 13 Amish Kanani: So land terms acres square feet sir, share that? Saharsh Rao: It five-acre plot. Amish Kanani: And sir , ssume niche generic, EBITDA margin range 17%, 17.5% . So assume niche generic would say 25% margin? Saharsh Rao: It really depends product -to-product would hard comment that. Moderator: Thank you. We take next question line Tushar Mundhane Anand Rathi. Please go ahead. Tushar Mundhane: With respect prime segment, would like understand volume growth pricing growth quarter? Saharsh Rao: So think within quarter pri products contributed 47% top line would imagine close Rs. 70 crores, Rs. 72 crores. S actually largely driven five six products part p rime category. Within products really given specific breakdown products . But terms general trends hard comment volume well pricing trends together group products de clining trend pricing, products price stability products price also increasing. Management: But generally overall expect revenue growth prime products aggressive, always modest growth products already established market share product growing ignificantly. Tushar Mundhane : API kind legacy , API kind business say let us say couple companies oil based products fall crude oil prices sharp reduction prices subseq uent fall raw material prices. So effect seen case also? Management : No, say prime products actually referring Neuland\\u2019s products , right . Prime mean actually commodity API s. So prime products us might actually good products somebody else . So think reasonably insulated margins significantly impacted crude oil prices . think macro fluctuation commodities impact price lvent smaller materials . But see huge impact margins prime APIs. Tushar Mundhane: And second question respect sequential drop gross margin, help understand ? Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 7 13 Management : So would encourage read much quarter quarter change gross margin slight change EBITDA margin product impact see fluctuation quarter -to-quarter basis. Tushar Mundhane: Because sequentially also seen improvement sales contribution CMS niche segment despite falling gross margin reason question? Management : Tushar , gross margins quarter 53% whereas full year last year slightly lower, 51%. So quarter okay, fairly compared n annualized basis last year okay. It line r slightly better. Moderator: Thank you. Next question line Ashish Rathi Infina Finance. Please go ahead. Ashish Rathi: wanted understand treat like base quarter going ahead assume see growth onwards, numbers? Saharsh Rao: So think mentioned earlier think growth achieved fundamental growth . And think journey business every quarter different charac teristic it. S cannot help clear definition . But think hopefully give enough clarity. Ashish Rathi: Okay secondly margins top line growing good margins still band like 15% 20% odd . We indicating around 20% . So like looking inflection point time look margins trajectory going forward ? mean see actually continual improvement happening sho uld wait junction ? Saharsh Rao: think inflection , Ashish , gradual ramp margin know margin business mix changes continues improve well operational leverage kicks in. So able generate turnover facilit ies. The combination two factors actually drive margins . When get certain milestone really dependent execute business mix . So hard us comment tell inflections, gradual move linear move well. Ashish Rathi: Just add terms debt position right sho uld see going ahead, debt number? Saharsh Rao: The debt position see almost like Rs. 175 crores . It terms net worth Rs. 195 crores . So lower one. T long term debt Rs. 45 crores short term debt working capital requirement Rs. 130 crores. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 8 13 Ashish Rathi: So intend repay debt look ? Will raising debts CAPEX need that? H ow keep debt syst em moving company\\u2019s basically ? Saharsh Rao: See look CAPEX position company said last quarters saying CAPEX year close Rs. 22 crores would largely fundi ng internal accruals. Management: And addition additional comment see goal keep debt always healthy level . Currently debt equity less 1 1.5 2 times considered reasonable risky . So always like keep debt equity healthy level . Working capital always around 30% overall sales, 2 8% 30%. So going forward would like maintain . Of course changes based requirement . It see always maintained levels. Moderator: Thank you. The n ext question line Saravanan Viswanathan Unifi Capital . Please go ahead. Saravanan Viswanathan: would like know Evolven ce exited parent company still shareholders? Saharsh Rao: think question asked previous calls well . Now since transaction happening holding company elabor ate process going . So yet complete. Saravanan Viswanathan: Okay terms real estate mentioned pertaining office space, quarter received specific income arrang ement terms initial fee something? Saharsh Rao: No, nothing. Saravanan Viswanathan: And last question . So assume moved Rs. 120 crore base Rs. 140 crore base terms quarterly revenue s? Saharsh Rao: That assumption make actually mentioned one previous participants think growth fundamental growth . But said always challenges business . But quite optimistic busines going forward well. But want give specific guidance terms base. Moderator: Thank you. Next question line Ayush Surana Ethos Capital. Please go ahead. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 9 13 Ayush Surana: one question ask . Have tied Israeli firm API contract, supplying them? Saharsh Rao: We cannot comment specific products sorry able answer that. Moderator: Thank you. Next question line Amish Kanani JM Financial. Please go ahead. Amish Kanani: question given niche proportion business quarter reasonably higher last quarter time, still EBITDA margins range . So would attrib ute ? So question given prime lowering still margins range, take apart say product mix might explanation? Saharsh Rao: think terms margins factor multiple actually combination multiple factors . So niche generic APIs increased many factors totally impact margin business. So hard us give kind firm factor margin improved . think go back previous comment say business mix continues increase operational leverage continues increase means continue generate revenue facilities anticipate margin continue increase. Amish Kanani: Sir, context operational capitalization kind put number there? Saharsh Rao: So believe facilities together operate two manufacturing facilities hey put together maintenance debottlenecking CAPEX would able generate Rs. 750 crores Rs. 850 crores revenue given optimal business mix . And something could change plus minus something thi nk possible existing facilities. Amish Kanani: So saying level margins improve saying? Saharsh Rao: Yes. Moderator: Thank you. Next question line Vishal Singhania, Retail investor. Please go ahead. Vishal Singhania: Sir, said last conference call expect reach full capacity FY17. So still stand that?

A nd part Anil also mentioned earlier comment level debottlenecking capacity creations within two facilities. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 10 13 Vishal Singhania: Okay sir next question sir, Teva Pharmaceuticals US said would launching Huntington disease drug second half financial year 2017, second half 2017 . So expect kind growth coming su pply APIs Huntington series? Saharsh Rao: So actually mentioned specifically customers working products obviously question cannot answer. Moderator: Thank you. Next question line f Sri Srihari PCS Securities. Please go ahead. Sri Srihari: Two questions basically . If talk complex generics space would like know meaningful opportunities, looking next 18 24 months ? And secondly custom manufacturing side mentioned six commercial molecules trying make entry . So kind market share might gained products? Saharsh Rao: So regards niche generic APIs right lot products comprise category talked Salmeterol, Paliperidone past molecules part category . think going forward continue strive launch products category result hope commercialize going forward. One products mentioned today\\u2019s call opening comments Deferasirox molecule part category, interesting product lo oking global market share. This molecule whose patent expires 2019 . Again time elaborate lot products molecules well Pro pofol, Escitalopram , Suga mmadex, Donepezil etcetera part category continue good opportunities Neuland going forward. There also product called Labetalol mentioned earlier updates molecule . That old molecule scaled up. Labetalol also example niche generic API wherein Neuland actually trying create good market opportunity molecule actually generic quite time. Sri Srihari: And Lurasidone ? Saharsh Rao: That molecule whic h part product list, still development . believe still early comment prospects . But validation molecule year. Sri Srihari: And regards six custom manufacturing product mentioned? Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 11 13 Saharsh Rao: With regards molecules obviously custom manufacturing molecules cannot delve details products . But strategy regards products varying could cases prime API supplier. There cases secondary supplier greater 50% share also cases secondary supplier less 50% share. All scenarios quite possible . But would also like say molecules always API supplier . There lot projects intermediate business. Sri Srihari: Right mean would position mean basically let us say kind satisfied market shares still lot scope go? Saharsh Rao: It continuous process think would like keep increasing market shares olecules . would say would never satisfied kind share . But really depends specific molecule ultimately contract manufacturing space typically offer molecules generic customer. So working innovator company exclusively. Sri Srihari: Okay four clinical stage late Phase -3? Saharsh Rao: So Phase -2 well Phase -3. Sri Srihari: Okay g ive addressable market size four products? Saharsh Rao: It would hard moment typically try frame market size molecules still clinic one data cl ear available . Second still lot uncertainties involve actually achieve market. Sri Srihari: So least therapies four belongs? Saharsh Rao: There actually couple CMS space . There one cardio vascular one actually antibiotic. Moderator: Thank you. The next question line Saravanan Viswanathan Unifi Capital. Please go ahead. Saravanan Viswanathan : would like know filing pipeline kind h ow many DMFs likely file year existing filings? Saharsh Rao: So intend develop 12 16 APIs FY17 obviously strategy would file DM F, CEPs well various ther filings including IDLs Chinese market . But Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 12 13 point time clear terms products get filed year not. But take intend scale 12 16. Management: And include CMS APIs well. So talking total number APIs . So may even DM F difficult us comment exact number DM Fs. Saravanan Viswanathan : And regards CMS broadly give geographical mix? Saharsh Rao: So CMS still growing business company therefore year -to-year mix could depend specific pro jects executing . But broadly steady state would currently 40% US, 30% Europe 20% 30% Japan. Moderator: Thank you. Next question line Hareesha Kakkera BOB Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hareesha Kakkera: Sir, wanted know like somewhere Annual Reports happened men tion like average going add 10 12 products product basket every year. And want know percentage would high value niche molecules percentage could CMS? Saharsh Rao: So Hareesha , generally speaking management philosophy shift business strategy prime focused organization niche focused organization ultimately believe niche Neuland\\u2019s capabilities better utilized . And greater opportunities facing less pricing pressure less pressure competitors niche generic space. So part strategy made conscious move focus niche generics. So result thi strategy lot focus development molecules niche generic APIs therefore answer question could envisaged significant part major part molecules would niche generic APIs . However, would always possibility us develop prime APIs present right opportunity Neuland come right technology gives us leadership. Hareesha Kakkera: So assume like could around 80% new additions would niche molecules? Management : Well tough comment exact percentage Hareesha keep changing maybe could say one third still continue molecules would eventually become prime . Because lot customers, old customers keep asking us develop molecules . Another third would niche another third would probably significantly niche. That typically product portfolio look like. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 13 13 Moderator : Thank yo u. As questions participants , would like hand floor Mr. S ucheth Rao closing comments . Over you, sir.

Diwakar Pingle : Welcome everyone thanks joining Q1 FY17 Earnings call Neuland Laboratories Limited. Please note results made also view website www.neulandlabs.com. To take us results thi quarter answer questions us management represented Mr. Sucheth Rao, Vice Chairman & CEO; Mr. Saharsh Rao, Joint Managing Director Anil Kumar CFO. We starting call brief view given Sah arsh providing brief company\\u2019s performance followed Q&A session. would like remind everything said call may reflects outlook future constitute forward -looking statement. It must viewed conjunction uncertainties risks face. These uncertainties risks included limited mentioned prospectus filed SEBI subsequent annual report find website. With said, turn call Mr. Saharsh Rao. Over you, sir. Saharsh Rao: Good morning everyone. A warm welcome logged call. Let start financial first move onto business highlights . For quarter Q1 FY17 total operating income Rs. 149.77 crores compared Rs. 123.72 crores quarter last year representing increase 21%. The EBITDA stood Rs. 25.05 crores compared Rs. 21.63 crores quarter FY16, increase 16%. The EBITDA margin 16.7% Q1 FY17 17.5 % Q1 FY16. Net profit stood Rs. 9.71 crores quarter compared Rs. 7.3 crores Q1 last financial year. Basic EPS stood Rs. 10.93 crores Rs. 8.22 crores Q1 FY16. If quickly dissect results key h ighlights would revenues highest quarter history company positive. The EBITDA margins stable must understand function product mix hence cons tant compared last quarter. When compare EBITDA quarter Q1 last fiscal difference due onetime payments Neuland received APIC part income Q1 FY16. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 3 13 Other highlights busine ss mix perspective 47% revenues came prime products, 29% niche API remaining 23% came CMS business. You would recall starting last quarter onwards management decided give business saliency information well breakdown shared part initiative. The CMS business also another highlight continues see improved traction project perspective company currently working 10 projects; 9 Q4 FY16 1 Q1 FY16 6 commercial stage 4 clinical stage. From operational perspective key highlights include successfully cleared ANVISA audit unit 2. This regulatory agency Brazil. Also continu ed business momentum Salmeterol one products talking gets commercialized. We added new customers well penetrated new markets product. Then progress new GDS API called Deferasirox addition new customers initiation supplies validation batches multiple geographies also another highlight would encouraging initial response Chinese pharmaceutical markets initiated sale several new APIs. So sum marize think strong quarter terms financial performance well operating parameters. We believe momentum build move forward cautiously confident growth prospects company fin ancial year. Having said this, would like throw open floor Q&A. Sucheth, Anil try respond much can. Over you, Diwakar. Moderator : Thank much, sir . Ladies gentlem en, begin question -and-answer session. We first question line Abdul Puranwala Centrum Broking . Please go ahead. Abdul Puranwala : My first question regarding revenue growth . So Q4 stated one deferred order passed Q1 current quarter. So tell would actual growth barring one particular order? Saharsh Rao: Abdul , think reference mad e previous quarter orders fulfilled end Q4 would spilled Q1. think referring comment, right? Abdul Puranwala : Yes, sir. Saharsh Rao: So think fair comment , Abdul , business always going orders, deliveries certain products going fall towards end month end Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 4 13 quarter invariably beyond operations control get bil led. So answer question specifically would difficult honest would continue kind spillovers opportunit ies normal business . So example would orders Q1 also may originall plan delivered Q1 may spilled Q2. So summary really prudent look impact growth achieved believe realistic fundamental growth. Abdul Puranwala : And second quest ion would regarding Salmeterol, new geography introduced Salmeterol? Saharsh Rao: So customers customers within European region , Abdul, probably second tier customers going late launches different countries within Europe well regions. Abdul Puranwala : And FY 18 given previously revenue guidance Rs. 750 crores still maintain that? Saharsh Rao: We actually never given revenue guidance , Abdul , sure comment coming from. Moderator: Thank you. Next question line Hareesha Kakkera BOB Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Hareesha Kakkera: wanted know growth rate Salmeterol achieved going ahead could growth rate? Saharsh Rao: Thanks question . We actually disclosed growth rate especially within product individually . So question would able answer. Hareesha Kakker a: And wanted know like phases molecules concentrating right now, seems Phase -2 Phase -3 continuing going ahead? Saharsh Rao: So typically approach CMS business , Haree sha, look opportunities Phase -2, Phase -3 right time us partner contract manufacturing organization . But way actually visualize business molecules continue Phase -2 Phase -3 commercialization time number commercial opportunities increase. So model hat pursuing . Having said pursue opportunity directly commercial well . So sometimes talk pharmaceutical compan ies already commercial molecule looking second supplier third supplier Neuland tries go enter role. So clinical part development become directly part commercial. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 5 13 Hare esha Kakkera: And new geographies tapping CMS business? Saharsh Rao: CMS typically focus Europe, North America Japan predominantly three main regions . On top also actively look opportunities Indian pharmaceutical companies well. But obviously different criteria within markets perhaps may able elaborate time limitations. Moderator: Thank you. Next question line Amish Kanani JM Financial. Please go ahead. Amish Kanani: Can give us flavor type products selling niche API given confidentiality may able name them, give us type API designing niche, one. And two, kind margins getting say vis-\\u00e0-vis blended margin business ? And third, also elaborate surplus land agreement much land flavor that? Saharsh Rao: With regards niche generic A PIs typically molecules differentiated either method use products . So typically injectable, APIs going injectable formula tion, APIs going trans dermal patches inhalation products etcetera another way defining niche API would molecule extremely complex nature chemically challenging manufacture it. What means market point view niche generic A PIs market may large opportunity company like Neuland penetrate market gain significant market share would quite high. So typically niche generic A PIs would large terms turnover topline, high terms margins well market share opportunity Neuland . And given examples molecules like Salmeterol , Propofol past . There molecule called Deferasirox talked release . We talked Paliperidone past . These examples niche generic A PIs. And regards margins would like comment specifically margin profile niche generics mentioned earlier comment typically higher margin products compared prime products . So therefore expect contribute positively margin business. And finally question Nanakramguda, property developed Phoenix actually joint development agreement . So Neuland actually contribute investments project land actually located one developing parts city lot corporate offices coming developer would actually build office space would shared ratio 23% 77% approximately. And Neuland\\u2019s point view, positive development without inv estments done past, able acquire 23% share. Neuland Laboratories Limited August 16, 2016 Page 6 13 Amish Kanani: So land terms acres square feet sir, share that? Saharsh Rao: It five-acre plot. Amish Kanani: And sir , ssume niche generic, EBITDA margin range 17%, 17.5% . So assume niche generic would say 25% margin? Saharsh Rao: It really depends product -to-product would hard comment that. Moderator: Thank you. We take next question line Tushar Mundhane Anand Rathi. Please go ahead. Tushar Mundhane: With respect prime segment, would like understand volume growth pricing growth quarter? Saharsh Rao: So think within quarter pri products contributed 47% top line would imagine close Rs. 70 crores, Rs. 72 crores. S actually largely driven five six products part p rime category. Within products really given specific breakdown products . But terms general trends hard comment volume well pricing trends together group products de clining trend pricing, products price stability products price also increasing. Management: But generally overall expect revenue growth prime products aggressive, always modest growth products already established market share product growing ignificantly. Tushar Mundhane : API kind legacy , API kind business say let us say couple companies oil based products fall crude oil prices sharp reduction prices subseq uent fall raw material prices. So effect seen case also? Management : No, say prime products actually referring Neuland\\u2019s products , right . Prime mean actually commodity API s. So prime products us might actually good products somebody else . So think reasonably insulated margins significantly impacted crude oil prices . think macro fluctuation commodities impact price lvent smaller materials . But see huge impact margins prime APIs. Tushar Mundhane: And second question respect sequential drop gross margin, help understand ?
